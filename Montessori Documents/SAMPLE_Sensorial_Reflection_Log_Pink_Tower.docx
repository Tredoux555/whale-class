Area: Sensorial
Age Group: 3-6 years

LESSON CONTEXT

Child(ren) Observed: Emma (5 years old)
Time of Day: 9:45 AM (Work Period)
Previous Experience: Emma has completed preliminary exercises with the Pink Tower twice before with teacher guidance.

PRESENTATION DETAILS

Materials Presented:
• Pink Tower (10 graduated cubes, smallest 1cm³ to largest 10cm³)
• Work mat
• Pink Tower stand

Objectives:
• Visual discrimination of dimension (size)
• Development of concentration
• Refinement of voluntary movement
• Preparation for mathematical concepts (seriation)
• Indirect preparation for understanding the decimal system

Key Teaching Points:
1. Carried cubes one at a time using proper three-finger grip (thumb, index, middle finger on top center of each cube)
2. Built tower from largest to smallest, placing each cube precisely in center of cube below
3. Demonstrated checking for alignment by running hand down corner of completed tower
4. Emphasized careful, controlled movement throughout

OBSERVATION OF CHILD'S WORK

Initial Response:
Emma approached the Pink Tower independently after completing her morning routine. She observed another child working with the Red Rods and seemed drawn to similar graduated materials. When I invited her to work, she smiled and nodded eagerly.

During the Activity:
• Emma carried all 10 cubes to her mat with excellent care - only needed one reminder to walk slowly
• She initially attempted to build from smallest to largest (natural progression) but self-corrected after placing third cube
• Demonstrated strong concentration - worked for 18 minutes without interruption
• Used proper three-finger grip consistently after initial modeling
• Made one error in sequencing (swapped cubes 6 and 7) but discovered it during alignment check
• Rebuilt that section independently without prompting
• Showed visible satisfaction when tower was complete and aligned

Language Development:
Emma used vocabulary: "big," "bigger," "biggest," "tiny," "enormous." I introduced "graduated" which she repeated with interest.

Social-Emotional Response:
• High engagement throughout
• Pride in completed work (asked if she could show her mother at pickup)
• Frustration tolerance: When she discovered her error, she paused briefly but chose to rebuild rather than abandon work
• Independence: Completed entire cycle without assistance after initial presentation

Physical Coordination:
• Developing refinement in voluntary movement
• Three-finger grip becoming more natural
• Spatial awareness improving - precise cube placement

ANALYSIS & REFLECTION

What Went Well:
The presentation was successful. Emma's readiness for independent work with this material is clear. Her self-correction during the alignment check demonstrates internalization of the control of error. The 18-minute work cycle indicates strong developing concentration.

What Could Be Improved:
In my presentation, I may have moved too quickly through the alignment check demonstration. Emma understood the concept but could benefit from more explicit language about what we're checking for (all corners aligned in one vertical line).

Unexpected Observations:
Emma spontaneously counted the cubes as she returned them to the stand (1-10), showing mathematical readiness I hadn't anticipated. This suggests she may be ready for introduction to the Number Rods in the Math area.

Montessori Principles Observed:
• Auto-education: Emma learned through her own discovery and self-correction
• Prepared environment: Material was complete, organized, and accessible
• Freedom with responsibility: Emma chose when to begin, how long to work, and when she was finished
• Control of error: The alignment check allowed Emma to find and fix her own mistake
• Concentration: Deep engagement with purposeful activity

NEXT STEPS

Immediate Follow-Up:
• Allow Emma to work with Pink Tower daily as desired to build mastery
• Observe for readiness to extend work (e.g., building blindfolded, building with pattern cards)

Future Presentations:
• Brown Stair (likely ready within 1-2 weeks based on today's performance)
• Introduction to language describing dimension (thick/thin)
• Continue building foundation for mathematical seriation with Number Rods

Connection to Curriculum:
This work supports Emma's development in:
- Sensorial discrimination (visual-dimensional)
- Order and sequence understanding
- Mathematical readiness (graduated series, base-10 preparation)
- Fine motor refinement
- Concentration and focus

Parent Communication:
Will share Emma's success with this material at next parent conference. Recommend observing similar graduated activities at home (e.g., stacking cups, nesting boxes) to support learning.

PERSONAL TEACHING GROWTH

What I Learned:
I'm becoming more confident in allowing longer periods of struggle before offering assistance. Emma's self-correction was more valuable than if I had pointed out the error. Trusting the prepared environment and the child's natural desire to perfect their work continues to be reinforced.

Skills to Develop:
I want to be more intentional about documenting spontaneous moments of mathematical readiness (like Emma's counting). These informal assessments are valuable for planning future lessons.
