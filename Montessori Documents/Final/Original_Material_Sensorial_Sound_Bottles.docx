ORIGINAL MATERIAL: SOUND MATCHING BOTTLES

WHAT IT IS

6 pairs of small bottles (12 total). Each pair makes the same sound when you shake it. Kids match bottles by sound.

Red caps = one set to stay on shelf
Blue caps = matching set that kids use

So they take a blue bottle, shake it, then try to find the red bottle that sounds the same.

WHY I MADE THIS

My kids loved the Sound Cylinders from our Montessori materials, but we only have one set and multiple kids wanted to use it. Fights were happening.

Also I wanted something with different sounds - not just wood hitting wood. Wanted variety.

MATERIALS TO BUILD IT

- 12 small plastic bottles with lids (like travel shampoo bottles - about 100ml size)
- Red spray paint (for 6 lids)
- Blue spray paint (for 6 lids)
- Filling materials:
  * Rice (soft rattling)
  * Dried beans (harder rattling)  
  * Sand (soft shushing)
  * Small pebbles (clicking sound)
  * Bells or jingle bells (ringing)
  * Beads (rolling sound)
- Strong glue (to seal lids permanently - safety)
- Storage basket or tray

HOW TO MAKE THEM

1. Clean all bottles thoroughly

2. Fill PAIRS of bottles with same material - same amount in each:
   - Bottle 1 red + Bottle 1 blue: rice (fill 1/3)
   - Bottle 2 red + Bottle 2 blue: beans (fill 1/4)
   - Bottle 3 red + Bottle 3 blue: sand (fill 1/2)
   - Bottle 4 red + Bottle 4 blue: pebbles (fill 1/4)
   - Bottle 5 red + Bottle 5 blue: small bells (2-3 bells each)
   - Bottle 6 red + Bottle 6 blue: beads (fill 1/3)

3. Seal lids with strong glue. Let dry completely. Check they're REALLY sealed - safety issue.

4. Spray paint lids (do this outside or well-ventilated area):
   - One set of 6 bottles gets RED lids
   - Other set of 6 bottles gets BLUE lids

5. Let paint dry for 24 hours

6. Put all bottles in basket

Cost: About $15 total
Time: 2 hours (plus drying time)

HOW TO USE IT (LESSON)

Presentation for first time:

1. Bring child and basket to quiet area (you need to HEAR the sounds)

2. Take out all red bottles. Line them up

3. Take out one blue bottle. Shake it. "Listen to the sound."

4. Pick up first red bottle. Shake it. "Is this the same sound?" 
   If no: put it back, try next red bottle
   If yes: "Yes! These match!" Put them together as a pair

5. Repeat with another blue bottle

6. Let child try with remaining blue bottles

7. When all are matched, shake each pair together to verify

8. Mix them up, return to basket

The control of error is the sound itself - if it doesn't sound the same, it's not a match.

WHAT I NOTICED IN MY CLASSROOM

Kids LOVE this. It's challenging but doable. The sound discrimination really makes them focus and listen carefully.

Some kids shake bottles really hard (trying to hear better) so make sure lids are glued well. I had one lid pop off in week 1 - beans everywhere. Now I use super strong glue.

This works well for:
- Kids with strong auditory learning style
- Kids who need to move (they get to shake things)
- Younger kids (3-3.5) because it's concrete and engaging

---

VARIATIONS I'VE TRIED

**Harder version**: Use materials that sound more similar (different types of rice, different types of beans). Makes it trickier.

**Blindfold version**: For older kids (5-6 years) who've mastered the basic version. Work with eyes closed, only using ears.

**Create your own**: Let kids help make a new pair. They choose what to put in bottles. Then we add it to the set.

---

PROBLEMS I SOLVED

Problem: Bottles look different (different fill levels visible through plastic)
Solution: Wrapped colored tape around middle of each bottle so you can't see inside. Now it's really about sound only.

Problem: Some sounds too similar (sand vs rice)
Solution: Make sure each pair is distinctly different. If two pairs sound close, change one.

Problem: Bottles roll off tables
Solution: Store them in a tray with sides, not flat basket.

MONTESSORI ALIGNMENT

Isolation of difficulty: Just focuses on sound (not size, color, weight - those are controlled)
Concrete learning: Can physically manipulate and test
Auto-education: The sound tells them if they're right
Preparation for: Music work, phonemic awareness (hearing subtle differences in sounds)

---

MAINTENANCE

Check weekly that lids are still secure
Replace any bottle if lid gets loose
Wipe down bottles with damp cloth as needed
Expected lifespan: Several years with proper care

---

ASSESSMENT

Kid has mastered this when they can:
- Match all 6 pairs correctly
- Work independently without checking with teacher
- Explain to another child how to do it
- Do it with eyes closed (advanced)

---

PERSONAL NOTES

This was my first original material I made from scratch. Pretty proud of it. It's simple but effective. Cost almost nothing. Kids use it constantly.

Best part: I made it on a Sunday afternoon while watching football. Montessori prep doesn't have to be complicated.
