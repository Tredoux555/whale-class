PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is the expansion of the mind map I created at the start of the year. That was the preliminary plan - this is the detailed version showing how it actually played out and where we're going.

Main Goal: Create a comprehensive Montessori PreK 4 program that serves 2-6 year olds with mixed abilities, cultural backgrounds (mostly Chinese ESL learners), and developmental levels.

SEPTEMBER 2024 - FOUNDATION MONTH

What I planned:
- Set up classroom environment
- Establish routines and ground rules
- Assess each child's current level
- Begin practical life presentations for everyone

What actually happened:
Pretty much as planned. First month is always about getting kids comfortable in the space. Lots of practical life work - pouring, spooning, folding. These activities calm kids down and build concentration.

Did initial assessments - some kids came in with zero English, some with lots. Ages ranged from 2.5 (Mia) to 5.5 (Emma). Big spread.

Established the basic routine: Morning greeting, choose work, work cycle (2.5 hours), cleanup, circle time, lunch.

Challenges: Two kids with separation anxiety (took 2 weeks to settle). One kid (Leo) very energetic - hard for him to focus. Language barrier with several families.

OCTOBER 2024 - PRACTICAL LIFE & SENSORIAL FOUNDATIONS

Focus: Heavy practical life for all. Sensorial presentations for kids showing readiness.

Practical Life introduced:
- Pouring (dry then wet)
- Spooning and tonging
- Sweeping
- Table washing
- Folding cloths
- Buttoning frames

Most kids could do at least 2-3 of these independently by end of month.

Sensorial introduced:
- Pink Tower (for Emma, Oscar, Sophia)
- Cylinder blocks (for older/ready kids)
- Color tablets Box 1 (basic colors)

By end of October, classroom routines were solid. Kids knew where materials go, how to get them out, how to return them.

NOVEMBER 2024 - EXPANDING SENSORIAL, BEGINNING MATH

Continued with practical life (those never stop).

Sensorial expansions:
- Brown Stair
- Red Rods
- Color Tablets Box 2
- Sound cylinders (then I made my sound bottles)

Math introductions:
- Number Rods (for Emma, Noah, Oscar)
- Spindle Boxes (for kids ready after number rods)
- Sandpaper numbers (starting with 1-5)

Language work:
- Started sandpaper letters with Mia (early starter)
- Three part cards for vocabulary building
- Group language games during circle time

November was when I really saw concentration developing. Kids working 15-20 minutes on one material without getting up.

---

DECEMBER 2024 - MATH & LANGUAGE ACCELERATION

This is when math and language really took off.

Math additions:
- Completed all number rod presentations
- Most older kids (4.5-5) now working with spindle boxes
- Introduction to teen boards (Emma only - she was ready)
- Made the number line on floor - huge hit

Language developments:
- Multiple kids now working through sandpaper letters
- Chloe started movable alphabet (encoding CVC words)
- Increased small object collection for word building
- Added more three part cards

Culture beginning:
- Introduced globe
- Started continent puzzle maps
- Kids asking lots of "where" questions

December was also Christmas/holiday season so did some cultural activities around that - different holiday traditions from different countries.

---

JANUARY 2025 - LANGUAGE EXPLOSION

This month was all about language.

Sandpaper letters: 6 kids now working through these regularly
Movable alphabet: 3 kids encoding words independently
Sound games: Added more during circle time - I spy, rhyming, syllable clapping

Made new materials:
- More small objects for word building (hit up the toy stores)
- Word lists for kids starting to read
- CVC picture cards

Math continued:
- Teen boards for 3 more kids
- Introduction to addition strip board (Emma and Oscar)
- Continued work with all earlier materials

Practical life:
- Added food prep activities (cutting fruit, making snacks)
- Kids now responsible for setting up snack area
- One kid "table monitor" each day checks tables are clean

Culture:
- Made continent animal matching cards (February but started prep in Jan)

---

FEBRUARY 2025 - CULTURE FOCUS

This month I really pushed culture curriculum.

Geography:
- Continent puzzle maps in regular rotation
- Globe work
- Landforms (land/water forms)
- Introduced flags (still working on this)

Biology:
- Parts of plants (three part cards)
- Animal classification (vertebrates/invertebrates with older kids)
- Continent animal matching cards I created

All kids now know 7 continents by name. Most can find them on globe or puzzle map.

Math & Language continued but culture was the emphasis this month.

---

MARCH 2025 - INTEGRATION & INDEPENDENCE (PLANNED)

Goals for March:
- Less teacher-directed presentations, more independent work
- Kids choosing their own work across all areas
- Peer teaching (older kids helping younger)
- Small group lessons for kids at similar levels

Focus on getting everyone working independently across all curriculum areas. If they've learned a material, they should be able to do it without asking for help every time.

Will continue introducing new materials to kids who are ready, but main goal is building independence with what they already know.

---

APRIL-MAY 2025 - ADVANCED WORK & READING PREP (PLANNED)

For advanced kids:
- Reading introduction (building on encoding work)
- More complex math (multiplication board, fraction work)
- Advanced geography (country studies, flags)
- Science experiments

For younger/developing kids:
- Solidifying foundations
- Mastering practical life skills
- Building confidence
- Preparing for next year's learning

Will do progress reports for parents mid-April showing development across all areas.

---

JUNE 2025 - CONSOLIDATION & CELEBRATION (PLANNED)

Last month is about:
- Reviewing what we learned all year
- Celebrating growth (kids look at their own work from September vs June)
- Preparing older kids for transition to next level
- Final parent conferences
- End of year presentation/showcase

Also cleaning and organizing classroom for next year.

---

MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT YEAR

Materials I made myself:
- Sound matching bottles (October)
- Number line jumping (December)
- Continent animal matching cards (February)
- Various three part cards
- Picture cards for vocabulary
- Small charts and lists

These filled gaps in our curriculum where purchased materials weren't working or weren't available.

---

PARENT INVOLVEMENT

September: Parent orientation meeting explaining Montessori method
October: First parent conferences (individual, 20 min each)
December: Holiday cultural celebration (parents brought traditional foods)
January: Parent observations (parents came to watch morning work cycle)
March: Second parent conferences (planned)
June: End of year conferences and showcase (planned)

Regular communication:
- Weekly class newsletter
- Daily sign-in book where I write quick notes about child's day
- Photos sent via class app
- Always available for questions/concerns

---

ASSESSMENT & RECORD KEEPING

What I'm tracking:
- Material presentations log (which kid got which lesson when)
- Observation notes (I do these during work cycle, later write reflections)
- Progress in each curriculum area (practical life, sensorial, math, language, culture)
- Social-emotional development notes
- Photos of children's work

Tools I use:
- Spreadsheet tracking presentations
- Observation journal
- Individual folders for each child with work samples
- Portfolio photos

This documentation helps me know who needs what next, who's advancing quickly, who needs more time.

CHALLENGES THIS YEAR

1. **Language barrier**: Many kids and parents don't speak fluent English. Had to get creative with communication. Using pictures, translators, simple language.

2. **Age range**: 2.5 to 5.5 years in one room. Huge developmental differences. Means a lot of differentiation.

3. **Space limitations**: Classroom isn't huge. Had to be strategic about material storage and work areas.

4. **Material shortages**: Some materials we just don't have. Made what I could, adapted what I couldn't.

5. **Behavior management**: Leo's energy level, Oscar's occasional defiance, Mia's social challenges. Every kid comes with something. Part of the job.

---

SUCCESSES THIS YEAR

1. **Concentration development**: Saw real growth here. Kids who couldn't focus for 5 minutes in September now working 20-30 minutes independently.

2. **Independence**: Most kids can now navigate the classroom, choose work, complete it, return it - all without constant teacher support.

3. **Academic growth**: Multiple kids who came in not knowing letters or numbers are now encoding words and working with teen numbers.

4. **Community**: Classroom feels like a community. Kids help each other, respect each other's work, take care of the space together.

5. **Parent buy-in**: Parents understand and support what we're doing. That helps a lot.

---

PERSONAL GROWTH AS TEACHER

What I learned this year:
- How to really observe (not just watch, but SEE what's happening)
- When to intervene vs when to stay back
- How to trust the materials and the children
- Better presentation skills (slower, clearer, more precise)
- Patience with the process - development takes time

What I still need to work on:
- Not rushing ahead when kids are doing well
- Better documentation/record keeping (always behind on this)
- More creative material making
- Stronger parent communication
- Self-care (teacher burnout is real)

---

ADJUSTMENTS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

Original plan was ambitious - wanted to introduce everything quickly. Reality: Had to slow down.

What changed:
- Culture curriculum started later (January instead of October)
- Reading introduction pushed back (most kids not ready until late spring)
- More time on practical life than I thought (turned out to be necessary)
- Added material making I hadn't planned (but needed)

What stayed the same:
- Basic curriculum sequence (practical life → sensorial → math/language → culture)
- Focus on independence and concentration
- Child-led work cycle
- Mixed-age grouping benefits

---

LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT YEAR

Things to improve:
- Start year with better classroom organization
- Have more materials ready from day one
- Clearer assessment system
- Better parent communication from the start
- More outdoor learning integration

Things to keep:
- Basic daily routine (it works)
- Material making when needed
- Focus on observation
- Mixed-age dynamic
- Strong practical life foundation

FINAL THOUGHTS

This year has been challenging and rewarding. Every day is different. Every kid is different. The plan guides me but I have to stay flexible and respond to what kids actually need, not what I think they should need.

That's Montessori - follow the child. Sometimes that means throwing out your beautiful plan and going in a completely different direction.

But having this framework helps. Knowing where we're heading, what materials come next, what skills we're building. The map isn't the territory but it helps you navigate.

Year's not over yet (writing this in February) but I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far. These kids have grown. As a teacher, so have I.
