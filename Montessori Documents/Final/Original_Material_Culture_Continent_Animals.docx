WHAT IT IS

Matching cards - one set shows continents, another set shows animals from those continents. Kids match animals to where they live.

Example: Kangaroo card goes with Australia card. Elephant goes with Africa. Panda goes with Asia.

WHY I NEEDED THIS

My kids knew the continents (we have the globe, puzzle map, all that). But they didn't really understand that different animals live in different places. This connects geography to real life.

Also animals are way more interesting to 4-year-olds than abstract continent shapes.

---

MATERIALS TO BUILD IT

- Photos of continents (printed from internet, one per continent)
- Photos of animals (3-4 animals per continent)
- Card stock or thick paper
- Laminating sheets
- Control chart (shows correct answers)
- Storage box or envelope

For my set I did 6 continents (left out Antarctica for now because limited animals kids recognize).

ANIMALS I CHOSE:
- Africa: Lion, elephant, giraffe, zebra
- Asia: Panda, tiger, monkey, snake
- North America: Bear, raccoon, deer, eagle
- South America: Jaguar, sloth, toucan, llama
- Europe: Fox, deer, owl, horse
- Australia: Kangaroo, koala, platypus, crocodile

HOW TO MAKE IT

1. Find pictures online (I used creative commons images, free to use)

2. Print them:
   - Continent cards: Full page size, clear labels
   - Animal cards: Quarter page size, with name labels

3. Mount on card stock

4. Laminate everything (important - gets handled a lot)

5. Make control chart: Page showing each continent with its animals

6. Put in storage box with label

Cost: About $20 (printing, laminating)
Time: 2-3 hours (mostly finding good images)

HOW TO PRESENT IT

**FIRST TIME (age 4+)**

1. Lay out continent cards

2. Pick up one animal card. "This is a lion. Lions live in Africa." Place it on Africa card.

3. Do 2-3 more examples

4. Hand animal cards to child. "Now you try. Where do these animals live?"

5. Watch them place cards

6. When done, bring out control chart. "Let's check your work together."

7. Don't make a big deal of errors - just say "Oh, let's look at the chart. Where does the panda live? Asia! Let's move it there."

**EXTENSIONS**

- Learn animal names (three period lesson)
- Talk about animal habitats (desert, jungle, grassland)
- Discuss why certain animals live in certain places (climate, food)
- Add more animals as kids learn
- Create stories about the animals

---

WHAT HAPPENS IN MY CLASSROOM

This is popular. Kids love animals. They'll work with this material for 20-30 minutes easily.

First few times they need the control chart a lot. After a week or two, most kids remember where animals go without checking.

Leads to interesting discussions:
- "Why don't pandas live in Africa?"
- "Can a kangaroo live in America?"
- "What animals live in Beijing?"

Good springboard for learning about climate, adaptation, ecosystems.

---

COMMON MISTAKES KIDS MAKE

- Putting ALL big cats together (lion, tiger, jaguar) because they look similar
- Confusing Asia and Africa (both have big landmasses)
- Thinking horses are only European (they're actually on multiple continents now)
- Wanting to put pet animals (dogs, cats) somewhere (I explain these live with people all over the world)

All of these are good teaching moments.

PROBLEMS I FIXED

**Problem**: Too many animals, overwhelming  
**Solution**: Started with just 2-3 animals per continent, added more later

**Problem**: Some animals live in multiple places  
**Solution**: Chose distinctive animals for each continent, avoided overlap

**Problem**: Kids argue about answers  
**Solution**: Control chart shows the "official" answers for our classroom

**Problem**: Cards getting damaged  
**Solution**: Laminated twice (double layer) for durability

MONTESSORI ALIGNMENT

Concrete learning: Visual cards they can touch and move
Self-correction: Control chart
Indirect preparation: World geography, biodiversity concepts
Connection to reality: Real animals, real places

---

WHEN TO INTRODUCE

After kids know:
- The seven continents (names and shapes)
- How to use matching materials
- Basic concept that animals live in different places

Usually age 4-5 years

---

SUCCESS INDICATORS

Kid has mastered when:
- Matches all animals to correct continents without control chart
- Can name most/all animals
- Begins to explain WHY ("Pandas eat bamboo, that grows in Asia")
- Shares facts about animals with other kids

---

FUTURE ADDITIONS

Planning to make:
- Set 2: Plants from each continent
- Set 3: Cultural items (musical instruments, traditional clothing)
- Set 4: Landmarks from each continent

Same matching format, different content. Kids who love this material will have more to explore.

---

PARENT RESPONSE

Sent home a picture of kids working with this. Parents loved it. Several asked questions about specific animals. One parent sent photos from their vacation to Africa and we added them to our classroom collection.

Nice way to connect home and school.

---

PERSONAL NOTES

This took more time than I expected (finding good images was tedious) but was totally worth it. Kids use it constantly and actually learn the content.

Also it's expandable - I can keep adding animals as we learn about them. Not a "done and finished" material.

Sometimes I wish I'd started with simpler categories (farm animals vs zoo animals) before jumping to continents. But kids adapted fine.
