Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Date: December 12, 2024
Material: Number Rods (1-10)
Child: Noah (4 years old)

THE SESSION

Noah has been counting everything lately - chairs, cups, toys, other kids. Constantly counting. So today seemed like the right time for Number Rods.

Started with just rods 1-3. Laid them out on a mat, showed him how to arrange them in order (stair pattern). "This is one. This is two. This is three."

He got it immediately. Could point to the right rod when I asked ("show me two"). Could count the sections on each rod. Happy with that, moved to rods 1-5.

Here's where it got messy. He could build the stair correctly but when I asked him to count the sections, he kept losing track. Especially on rods 4 and 5. He'd count "1, 2, 3, 4... 4?" Not sure if he got to 5.

We went back to just rod 5 alone. Counted together slowly, touching each red and blue section as we counted. Did this maybe 4 times. He got better at it but I could see he was getting tired.

WHAT WORKED

Starting small (1-3 rods) was right. Built confidence.

The color sections help with counting - you can see and touch each one.

Noah's enthusiasm - he WANTED to learn this, wasn't forced.

---

WHAT DIDN'T WORK

Moving to 5 rods too quickly. Should have stayed at 3 for this first session, maybe added 4 next time.

My counting demo probably wasn't slow enough. Need to exaggerate the touch-and-count rhythm so kids really get one-to-one correspondence.

The mat was too small - rods kept sliding around. Need a bigger work space.

OBSERVATIONS ABOUT NOAH

Can rote count to 10 (memorized sequence) but one-to-one correspondence is still developing. That's normal for 4 years old.

Good fine motor - handled the rods carefully.

Concentration for about 15 minutes then faded. Also normal.

Shows genuine interest in math which is great - we can build on that.

---

NEXT STEPS

Stick with rods 1-4 for the next few sessions until he's solid.

Do more counting activities throughout the day - count stairs, count blocks, count anything. He needs more practice with one-to-one correspondence outside of this material too.

Eventually add the number cards (1-10) to match with the rods, but that's weeks away.

Maybe introduce Spindle Boxes in parallel - different way to work on same concept.

PARENT CONNECTION

Noah's dad is an engineer so he's happy Noah likes numbers. But I'll need to remind him this is foundation work - we're not trying to make Noah do addition and subtraction yet. Just understanding quantity is one, two objects is two, etc.

WHAT I'M LEARNING

I keep rushing. This is a pattern. See a kid do well with the first few steps and immediately jump ahead. Need to slow down and let mastery happen at the child's pace not my pace.

Also my demonstrations can be better. I know what I'm doing but I need to remember how to break it down for someone seeing it for the first time. Touch each section, count out loud clearly, move slowly.

This is my third year teaching but I'm still learning how to teach if that makes sense.
