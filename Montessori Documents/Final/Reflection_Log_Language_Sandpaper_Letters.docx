Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Date: January 8, 2025
Material: Sandpaper Letters  
Child: Mia (3.5 years old)

BACKGROUND

Mia is young for this work (most kids start around 4) but she's been showing all the signs - tracing letters in the air, asking "what letter is that" constantly, trying to write her name. Her fine motor is also really good for her age. Decided to give it a shot.

THE LESSON

Started with just three letters: 'm' (for Mia), 's' (for her little sister Sophia), and 't' (random choice, simple form).

Showed her the method - trace with two fingers (index and middle), always starting at the starting point (marked with a green dot on our letters). Say the SOUND not the name: "mmm" not "em."

She loved it. Traced each letter maybe 10 times. Kept saying the sounds. Wanted to keep going with more letters but I stopped at three. That's the rule - three at a time for new learning.

Second period test: "Can you find mmm?" She did it every time. Same for 's' and 't'. Good.

Third period: Pointed to 'm' and asked "what sound?" She said "mmm." Perfect. Same for the other two.

Whole thing was maybe 20 minutes. She wanted to continue but I could see her focus starting to drift so we stopped.

WINS

She's ready for this material - both developmentally and interest-wise.

The three-period lesson worked textbook perfect. She moved through all three periods smoothly.

Her finger control is excellent. She stayed in the boundaries of the letters, followed the correct direction.

Starting with letters from her name was smart - made it personal and relevant.

PROBLEMS

None really. This was a good session.

Well, one thing - she kept saying "M for Mia" which is the letter NAME not the SOUND. I had to remind her a few times "we say mmm not M." This is going to be ongoing - everyone teaches letter names (books, TV, parents) so kids come in with that. We need the sounds for reading so it's a whole re-teaching thing.

ANALYSIS

Mia is going to move fast with this. She has the interest and the ability. I'm guessing she'll know all the consonants within 2-3 months, vowels maybe another month after that.

Need to watch that she doesn't get too focused on letters and neglect other areas (practical life, sensorial). It's easy for kids to obsess over one thing. Will need to gently guide her to other work too.

NEXT STEPS

Tomorrow or next session: review m, s, t. If solid, add three more letters. I'm thinking 'a', 'c', 'b' - simple forms, useful sounds.

Eventually move to the Movable Alphabet for word building but that's a while away. She needs to know at least 10-12 letter sounds before that makes sense.

Parent communication: Mia's parents are going to be excited. They're very academic. Need to remind them NOT to do flashcard drills at home. Keep it playful - "I spy something that starts with mmm."

TEACHING NOTES

Three-period lesson is a fantastic tool when you actually use it right. I've been doing Montessori for a while now and this is the structure that really works. Don't skip periods. Don't rush. Let the child show you when they're ready for the next period.

Also good reminder that younger kids CAN do this work if they're showing readiness. Age is just a guide not a rule.
