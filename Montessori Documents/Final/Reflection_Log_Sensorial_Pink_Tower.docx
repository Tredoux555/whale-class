MONTESSORI TEACHING REFLECTION

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Date: October 18, 2024
Material: Pink Tower
Child: Emma (5 years old)

WHAT HAPPENED

Emma picked the Pink Tower this morning after breakfast. She's done it maybe twice before with me watching closely, but today she wanted to try alone.

I set her up on a mat in the quiet corner. She carried all the cubes over - did the whole thing properly with two hands for the bigger cubes, three fingers on top for the smaller ones. Only had to remind her once to slow down because she was getting excited.

The actual building part took her about 15 minutes. Started from biggest to smallest which is correct. But here's what was interesting - she put cube 6 and cube 7 in the wrong order. Didn't notice at first. When she did the alignment check (running her hand down the corner like I showed her), she stopped. Looked at it. Didn't say anything but you could see her thinking. Then she took apart the top section and rebuilt it correctly.

Nobody told her to do that. She just figured it out.

When she finished she sat back and smiled. Asked if she could show her mom later. I said yes of course.

WHAT WENT WELL

The self-correction was beautiful. This is exactly what we want - the material teaching the child, not me having to point out every mistake. The Pink Tower's control of error worked perfectly. When the cubes don't align, you can feel it when you run your hand down the edge.

Emma's concentration was solid. 15 minutes is good for her age. Nobody interrupted her, the space worked well, she had everything she needed.

Her fine motor skills are improving. The three-finger grip on the small cubes was much better than last week.

WHAT COULD IMPROVE

I think I rushed the alignment check demonstration last time. Emma understood the concept but I should have been clearer about WHY we check - not just that we do it. Next time I'll say something like "we check if all the corners line up in one straight line."

Also noticed she counted the cubes when putting them back (1 to 10). I should have picked up on that - she's ready for more math work. Number Rods probably.

MONTESSORI PRINCIPLES I SAW

Auto-education - Emma learned through her own doing, not me lecturing
Control of error - the misalignment told her something was wrong
Freedom and responsibility - she chose the work, chose when to start and stop
Concentration - deep focus on the task
Respect - I didn't interrupt even when I saw the error

---

NEXT STEPS

Let Emma work with Pink Tower whenever she wants for the next week or two. Build confidence and mastery.

Then introduce Brown Stair - similar concept but different dimension (thick to thin instead of big to small).

Start Number Rods in math area - she's clearly ready based on that spontaneous counting.

At parent conference next month, I'll mention this to her mom. Maybe suggest some graduated toys at home like stacking cups or nesting boxes.

WHAT I LEARNED AS A TEACHER

I'm getting better at keeping my mouth shut. Used to jump in too fast when kids made mistakes. Today I waited, and Emma figured it out herself. That's worth more than me correcting her 10 times.

Also need to pay more attention to those little moments - like the counting. Easy to miss if you're not watching closely. These informal observations tell you when a child is ready for the next step.
