REFLECTION - COLOR TABLETS (BOX 2)

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse  
Date: November 22, 2024
Material: Color Tablets Box 2 (pairs)
Child: Sophia (4 years old)

CONTEXT

Sophia mastered Box 1 (primary colors) two weeks ago. Today she was ready for Box 2 - the paired tablets with 11 colors. This is where it gets interesting because the differences are more subtle.

WHAT I SAW

Set her up at a table in good light (important for color work). Showed her how to mix up all the tablets and then find the matching pairs.

She jumped right in. Started making pairs immediately - red, blue, yellow (the obvious ones from Box 1). Then got to pink and purple and hesitated. Held them up to the light. Looked at me. I stayed quiet.

She figured it out. Put pink with pink, purple with purple. But then she got stuck on brown and gray. Kept switching them back and forth. Eventually asked "which one is which?"

Good question. Shows she's thinking. I did a quick review - "this deep dark color is brown, this lighter color without much color is gray." She got it after that.

Whole activity took about 20 minutes. She found all 11 pairs eventually. Was proud of herself.

ANALYSIS

Sophia's visual discrimination is developing well. She could see that things didn't match even if she couldn't name the colors yet.

Language is the next step. She knows "red, blue, yellow" but not the secondary colors yet. That's normal for 4 years old. The language will come with repeated exposure.

Good self-awareness - she knew when she needed help and asked. That's actually a skill. Some kids just guess and move on.

ISSUES

I think the lighting in that corner wasn't quite good enough. The brown/gray confusion might have been partly lighting. Need to move the color work to the window side of the room.

Also I jumped into Box 2 maybe a week too early. Box 1 was "mastered" but she could have used a bit more time with it to really solidify. Not a big problem but worth noting.

NEXT STEPS FOR SOPHIA

Keep working with Box 2 until she's consistently getting all pairs right without asking for help.

Start introducing color names casually during the work - "oh you found the orange pair, good job" etc. Don't drill it, just expose her to the words.

Eventually Box 3 (gradations) but that's probably 2-3 weeks away.

CLASSROOM ADJUSTMENTS

Move the color materials to better light.

Maybe create a language card set with color names for kids who are ready for that extension.

PERSONAL NOTES

I'm still learning when to help vs when to wait. Today I waited and Sophia asked for help which was perfect. But I need to trust that process more. My instinct is always to jump in and "help" (aka rob them of the learning opportunity).

Montessori is hard because it looks like you're doing nothing. Just sitting there. But that's actually the most important part - observation and knowing when NOT to interfere.
