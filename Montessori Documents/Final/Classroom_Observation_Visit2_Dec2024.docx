PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Room setup looks good. All materials accessible at child height. Work mats stacked neatly in their basket. Tables clean from yesterday (kids did table washing during cleanup).

Math area: Number Rods in order, Spindle Boxes complete, Teen Boards present. New material I added last week (number line on floor) is getting used - good.

Language area: Movable Alphabet organized, Sandpaper Letters in their box, plenty of small objects for encoding practice.

Sensorial: Pink Tower, Brown Stair, Color Tablets all present and complete. Noticed Color Tablet Box 2 is missing one pink tablet - need to find that.

Practical Life: Looking a bit messy. The pouring station has water on the tray from yesterday. Buttoning frame needs to be re-buttoned (someone left it unbuttoned). Sweeping materials are there but the dustpan is cracked - need new one.

Overall: 7/10. Room is functional but needs some attention to detail.

CHILDREN'S WORK (OBSERVATIONS)

9:15 AM - Emma (5) chose Pink Tower. Built it independently, no help needed. Did the alignment check correctly. Repeated the work twice. Strong concentration. She's ready for more challenging sensorial work.

9:30 AM - Noah (4) and Leo (4.5) both wanted the Number Rods. Mini conflict. I redirected Noah to Spindle Boxes instead. He was okay with that but not thrilled. Note: Maybe need a second set of number materials? Popular area.

9:45 AM - Mia (3.5) working with Sandpaper Letters. She's been on these for 20 minutes. Really focused. Traced each letter multiple times. Saying the sounds correctly. Impressive for her age.

10:00 AM - Sophia (4) at the art table painting. Not sure this is the most productive use of her time - she does art every day. May need to gently guide her toward other areas. Though she seems happy and focused.

10:15 AM - Observed Chloe (4.5) using the Movable Alphabet to build words. She built "cat" "sun" "dog" "hat" independently. Very proud of herself. This is exactly what we want to see - independent work with challenging material.

10:30 AM - Lucas (5) chose the practical life area - pouring work. Made a mess (water everywhere) but cleaned it up himself with the sponge. Good self-correction. Repeated the pouring 5-6 times. Got better each time.

10:45 AM - Zoe (5) working with the Continent Globe. Spinning it, looking at different continents. Asked me "Where is China?" Good question. We found it together. She wants to learn more about different countries.

TEACHER ROLE

I presented one new material today: Teen Boards to Emma. She was ready for it based on her work with Number Rods. Presentation went well - took about 15 minutes.

Rest of the time was observation and minimal intervention. Helped Noah find work when he couldn't decide (around 10:40). Reminded two kids to walk (not run) during transition time.

Spent about 20 minutes observing without interacting - just watching work cycles, noting what materials are being used, who needs what next.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

**Material organization**: Need to do a deep clean of Practical Life area. Some trays are grimy. Missing pieces.

**Language materials**: Could use more small objects for word building. Running low.

**Transitions**: Some kids struggling with choosing work independently. May need to do a group lesson on "how to choose work."

**Social dynamics**: Noah and Leo keep gravitating toward same materials. Need to observe this pattern - are they actually friends or just competitive? May need to seat them apart at circle time.

POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS

**Independence**: Most kids can now choose work, get it themselves, work independently, and return it without constant checking in. This is huge progress from September.

**Concentration**: Multiple kids working for 15-20+ minutes on one material. Work cycle is solidifying.

**Care of materials**: Generally good. Kids handle materials carefully, return them to proper places. 

**Peer learning**: Saw Emma show Sophia how to use the Brown Stair. Unprompted, just helpful. Love this.

MATH/LANGUAGE FOCUS (VISIT 2 SPECIFIC)

Math materials being used regularly. Number Rods, Spindle Boxes, and the new number line are all popular. Kids are building strong foundation in quantity and numeral recognition.

Language area is active. Sandpaper Letters being used daily. Movable Alphabet starting to be used by older kids for encoding. Reading prep is happening.

Need to remember: Montessori math and language happens throughout the day, not just with "math materials." Counting during snack, writing their names at sign-in, reading labels around room - all counts.

CONCERNS

**One concern**: Leo (4.5) seems to be avoiding practical life work. Always chooses sensorial or tries to get to math materials. May need to guide him back to some practical life exercises to build those skills too. Can't skip areas.

**Another concern**: Mia is doing great with letters but struggling with social interactions. Tends to work alone, doesn't join group activities willingly. Need to watch this - academic skills developing but social-emotional may need support.

NEXT STEPS

For classroom:
- Fix/replace cracked dustpan
- Find missing pink color tablet
- Deep clean practical life area
- Order more small objects for language work

For specific kids:
- Emma: Introduce Brown Stair, expand math work
- Noah: Continue with Spindle Boxes, add new practical life exercises  
- Mia: Keep supporting language development, watch social-emotional
- Leo: Guide toward more balanced work choices across all areas
- Chloe: She's ready for reading prep - start introducing word lists

OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Morning work cycle was productive. Most children engaged meaningfully with materials. Room environment mostly supports learning well. Some areas need attention but nothing urgent.

Kids are progressing in their math and language understanding. Seeing good development in both areas. The ones who started the year not knowing letter sounds are now working with movable alphabet. The ones who couldn't count past 5 are now working with teen numbers. Progress is real.
