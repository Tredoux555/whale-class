PRACTICAL LIFE LESSON PLAN: POURING LIQUIDS

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Area: Care of Self / Practical Life
Age: 2.5 - 4 years

---

MATERIALS
- 2 small pitchers (about 150ml each)
- 1 small tray
- 1 sponge
- Water (or colored water to make spills visible)
- Small towel for tray

---

AIMS

Direct:
- Learn to pour liquid from one container to another
- Develop hand-eye coordination
- Build concentration

Indirect:
- Independence (can pour own drinks later)
- Preparation for other transfers (dry pouring, spooning, etc.)
- Care of environment (cleaning up spills)

PRESENTATION STEPS

1. INVITE THE CHILD
"Would you like to learn how to pour?" Bring the child and tray to a table.

2. SETUP
Place tray on table. Put both pitchers on tray. Fill one pitcher about 3/4 full. Make sure child is sitting so they can see everything clearly.

3. SHOW SLOW
Pick up the full pitcher with your dominant hand. Hold it at the handle. Show the child where you're holding it.

Pour slowly into the empty pitcher. REALLY slowly. Pour all the water. Put the pitcher down gently.

4. NOW THE OTHER WAY
Pick up the now-full pitcher (the one you just poured into). Pour slowly back into the first pitcher. Put it down.

5. INVITE CHILD TO TRY
"Now you try." Sit back. Let them do it.

6. OBSERVE
Watch but don't interrupt. If they spill (they probably will), wait. See if they reach for the sponge. If not, after they finish pouring, show them: "When we spill, we use the sponge." Show them how to wipe up.

7. REPEAT
Let child pour back and forth as many times as they want. This is the work - the repetition builds the skill.

8. RETURN MATERIAL
When child is done, they pour out the water (into a small bucket you've set aside), dry both pitchers with towel, return tray to shelf.

COMMON ISSUES

**Spills everywhere**: Normal at first. Just show sponge use. Don't make a big deal of it.

**Rushing**: Say "try moving more slowly" and model again if needed.

**Wrong grip**: Gently correct: "Hold it here by the handle."

**Loses interest after one pour**: That's okay. They can come back to it later. Don't force it.

VARIATIONS (LATER)

- Use dry materials first (rice, beans) before water - easier to clean up
- Smaller/larger pitchers - different difficulty levels
- Funnel pouring - harder, more precise
- Pouring into multiple small cups - dividing quantities

---

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

Child can pour water from one pitcher to another with minimal spilling. Can clean up their own spills. Chooses this work independently. Eventually: can pour their own drink at snack time.

NOTES FROM MY CLASSROOM

This is one of the first practical life exercises I do with kids. It's simple but they love it. Something about the water is fascinating.

Pro tip: Use colored water (food coloring) at first so spills are easy to see. Clear water is harder to track.

Also get small pitchers. The ones I first used were too big for little hands. Hardware store measuring cups work great.

Some kids do this activity every day for weeks. That's fine. They're building coordination and confidence. Don't rush them to the next thing.
