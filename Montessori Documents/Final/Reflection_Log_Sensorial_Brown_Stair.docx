TEACHING REFLECTION - BROWN STAIR

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Date: November 5, 2024
Material: Brown Stair
Child: Leo (4.5 years old)

SETUP

Leo's been watching other kids use the Brown Stair for about a week. Today he asked if he could try it. Good sign - shows he's observing and learning from the environment.

Got him set up on a mat. Showed him how to carry the prisms - both hands, prism horizontal, against his body. He did fine with the bigger ones but struggled a bit with the smallest. They're awkward to hold when your hands are small.

THE WORK

He built the stair correctly on the first try. Thickest to thinnest, all aligned on one side. Took him about 12 minutes which is pretty quick.

But here's the thing - I don't think he really got the concept yet. He was copying what he'd seen others do rather than understanding the dimension (thickness). When I asked him to describe what made the prisms different, he said "they're different colors" (they're all brown) and then "different sizes" which is too general.

Did the three-period lesson with him after. "This is thick. This is thin. This is medium." He could point to them when I asked (second period) but couldn't name them spontaneously yet (third period). That's okay - he needs more time with the language.

WHAT WORKED

The material itself worked well. Leo stayed focused and completed the task.
The prepared environment - he'd observed enough to know generally what to do.
My decision to do the three-period lesson - identified that he needs more language work with dimensions.

---

WHAT DIDN'T WORK

I should have started with just three prisms (thick, medium, thin) instead of all ten. Too much too fast for him. Classic mistake - assuming readiness just because a child can physically build something.

Need to slow down the language introduction. He's still working on "big/small" - thick/thin is more abstract.

---

OBSERVATIONS

Leo's fine motor is good - he handled the prisms well.
Concentration is developing - stayed with it the whole time.
Visual discrimination is there - he could see the differences.
Language/conceptual understanding - not quite there yet.

---

NEXT STEPS

Work with just the three extreme prisms (thickest, medium, thinnest) for the next few sessions.
Build language gradually - lots of three-period lessons.
Make sure he's solid with big/small concepts in other materials before pushing thick/thin.
Maybe go back to Pink Tower too - he might need more work with general size concepts.

Parent note: Leo's mom asked why he's not "advanced" like some other kids. Need to explain that Montessori isn't a race - every child develops at their own pace. Leo's doing exactly what he should be doing at 4.5 years old.

TEACHER REFLECTION

I got ahead of myself. Saw him watching the material and assumed he was ready. Watching doesn't always mean ready. Need to do better assessment before presentations.

Good thing is I caught it quickly and adjusted. That three-period lesson showed me exactly where he's at. Now I know how to help him.

Also reminder: don't rush language. Concrete experience first, language later. Leo needs more hands-on time before the vocabulary will stick.
