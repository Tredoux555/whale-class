REFLECTION - MOVABLE ALPHABET (CVC WORDS)

Material: Movable Alphabet
Child: Chloe (4.5 years old)

SETUP

Chloe knows about 15 letter sounds now (been working through Sandpaper Letters for 3 months). Today felt like the right time to introduce the Movable Alphabet and start building words.

Got her set up with the alphabet box and a small mat. Also brought three objects: cat (toy), sun (picture card), and pin (actual safety pin).

---

HOW IT WENT

Showed her the first object (cat). "What is this?" She said "cat." Good.

"What sound do you hear at the beginning of cat? Ccc-aaa-ttt?" She said "c."  
"Find the 'c' and put it here." She did.

"What's the middle sound? Ccc-aaa-ttt?" She said "a."  
"Good, find 'a' and put it next to the c." She did.

"Last sound? Ccc-aaa-ttt?" She said "t."  
"Find 't'." She did.

"Now let's read it. Touch each letter and say the sound." She did: "c-a-t... CAT!" Her face lit up. She got it. She actually SAW that these symbols make a word.

That's the magic moment. When it clicks.

We did two more words (sun, pin) and she built both of them with minimal help. Needed reminders to really listen for the middle sound but got there.

Session was about 25 minutes.

WHAT WORKED

The concrete objects helped. She could touch the cat, hold the pin. Made it real.

Starting with simple CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words was right. Three letters, clear sounds.

My exaggerated pronunciation - stretching out each sound - helped her hear them separately.

She has enough letter knowledge to do this. We didn't hit any letters she doesn't know yet.

---

WHAT DIDN'T GO PERFECTLY

She wanted to spell her name and I said no, which made her a bit frustrated. Her name has a silent 'e' at the end and some complex sounds. Too hard right now. I explained we need to start with simple words but I don't think she really got why. She's 4.5 - "my name" is the most important thing in the world.

Also the alphabet box is a bit disorganized. Letters get mixed up. I need to spend time reorganizing it - make sure all the c's are in the c section etc.

---

OBSERVATIONS

Chloe has good phonemic awareness (hearing individual sounds in words). This is key for reading and she's got it.

Fine motor is good - she can pick up the small letters and place them precisely.

Concentration is strong - she stayed engaged the whole time.

She's ready for more of this work.

NEXT STEPS FOR CHLOE

Build more 3-letter words. I'll collect more small objects and pictures for her to encode (cat, dog, hat, mop, bed, etc.).

When she's really solid with CVC words, we can move to 4-letter words (slip, drum, etc.) and eventually more complex patterns.

Reading comes after encoding. Once she can build words, she can start reading word lists and eventually books.

Her name can be a reward later - "once you can spell 10 words on your own, we'll do your name together."

---

CLASSROOM NOTES

Need to organize that alphabet box better. Maybe even make a second one so two kids can work simultaneously.

Collect more small objects for word building - hitting up the toy stores.

Create some simple word lists for kids who are ready to start reading after they've mastered encoding.

---

PERSONAL REFLECTION

This is my favorite part of language work - when kids realize they can BUILD words, not just memorize them. Chloe's face when she read "cat" after building it... that's why I teach.

Also learning to say no to kids when their request is beyond their level right now. It's hard because you want to say yes to everything, but sometimes no is the right answer. Chloe wanted her name, I said not yet, and the world didn't end. She moved on. I need to trust that.
