LESSON: BUTTONING

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse  
Area: Care of Self / Dressing Frames
Age: 3.5 - 5 years

MATERIALS

Buttoning frame - wooden frame with two pieces of cloth attached, one side has buttons, other side has buttonholes. Should have 4-5 large buttons to start.

---

WHY THIS MATTERS

Kids need to button their own jackets, sweaters, sometimes pants. This teaches them how without the pressure of being late for outdoor time or wearing their coat backwards while trying to figure it out.

Also it's great for fine motor development. Buttons are small and require precision.

HOW TO TEACH

1. SETUP  
Invite child to table. Place frame in front of them with buttons already buttoned (cloth closed).

2. UNBUTTONING FIRST (easier)
"Watch how I unbutton."

Start from TOP button. Hold the button side with left hand. Hold the buttonhole side with right hand. Push button through hole. Move down to next button. Repeat for all buttons.

Open the flaps to show the cloth is now separated.

3. BUTTONING (harder)
"Now watch how I button it up."

Start from BOTTOM button. Hold button side with right hand. Hold buttonhole side with left hand. Push button halfway through the hole. Then pull button all the way through. Move up to next button. Repeat for all buttons.

4. CHILD'S TURN
"Now you try." Re-button the frame first so they can practice unbuttoning. Let them unbutton all of them.

Then watch them try to re-button. This is where it gets tricky.

5. HELP AS NEEDED
If they're struggling, don't just do it for them. Instead:
- "Hold this side steady"
- "Push the button halfway through first"
- "Now pull it through"

Guide their hands if needed but try to let them do as much as possible.

COMMON ISSUES

**Skipping buttons** - they button the top button to the second hole, so everything is offset. Happens constantly. Just point it out: "Look, this button doesn't have a hole. Let's undo these and try again."

**Backwards** - trying to push button from the wrong side. Flip the frame around and show them which way.

**Gives up** - buttoning is hard. If they get frustrated, do it together: "I'll hold this side, you push the button." Or just let them practice unbuttoning for a while. That's valuable too.

PROGRESSION

Start with: Large buttons (1.5-2cm)
Then: Medium buttons (1cm)
Then: Small buttons (like on a real shirt)
Eventually: Tiny buttons (dress shirts, fancy clothes)

---

REAL WORLD CONNECTION

Once they've practiced on the frame, point out buttons in the classroom: "Oh, Oscar's jacket has buttons just like the ones you practiced! Want to try buttoning it?"

Actually using the skill on real clothes is the goal.

MY EXPERIENCE

This takes WEEKS. Maybe months for some kids. Don't rush it. The first time a kid buttons their own jacket without help... you feel like a genius teacher. They feel like they conquered Everest. Worth the wait.

I've noticed kids who master this tend to be more independent in other areas too. There's something about "I can dress myself" that builds major confidence.

EXTENSIONS

- Button snap frames (different mechanism, same concept)
- Zipping frame (similar but different motor pattern)
- Hook and eye frame (tiny, requires precision)
- Real clothes - button up shirts, jackets

Eventually they can help younger kids button their coats. Full circle.

WHEN THEY'VE GOT IT

Signs of mastery:
- Can button and unbutton 4-5 buttons independently
- Doesn't skip holes
- Can button their own jacket without help
- Can help a friend with their buttons
