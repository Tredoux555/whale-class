PRACTICAL LIFE LESSON: SWEEPING

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Area: Care of Environment
Age: 3 - 5 years

---

WHAT YOU NEED

- Child-size broom (important - adult brooms don't work)
- Child-size dustpan
- Small brush (for dustpan)
- Tape or rug to mark "sweeping area"
- Some crumbs or paper scraps to sweep (for demo)

---

WHY WE DO THIS

Kids need to help with classroom maintenance. Sweeping teaches:
- How to care for their environment
- Coordination (sweeping is harder than it looks)
- Responsibility
- Independence

Also they LOVE it. Give a 3-year-old a broom and watch them go crazy.

HOW TO TEACH IT

STEP 1: SHOW THE TOOLS
"This is how we sweep. First we get the broom and dustpan."

STEP 2: MAKE A MESS (ha)
Drop some paper scraps or crumbs on the floor in your designated area.

STEP 3: DEMONSTRATE
- Hold broom with both hands
- Sweep in smooth motions (not stabbing at the floor)
- Sweep all crumbs into one pile
- Hold dustpan flat on floor
- Sweep pile into dustpan
- Use small brush to get last bits into dustpan
- Dump into trash
- Return tools to their spot

Do this SLOWLY. They need to see each step.

STEP 4: THEIR TURN
Make another small mess. "Now you try."

STEP 5: STAND BACK
Let them figure it out. They'll probably sweep crumbs everywhere at first. That's fine. Don't jump in unless they ask for help.

COMMON PROBLEMS

**Sweeping everything all over the classroom**: Happens. Use tape to mark a small sweeping area at first. "We sweep inside the tape."

**Can't get crumbs into dustpan**: The angle is tricky. Show again how to hold the dustpan flat on the floor and sweep right into it.

**Fighting over the broom**: You need more than one broom. I have three in my classroom.

**Making mess on purpose to sweep it**: This is actually fine? They're practicing. Just set a limit: "You can make a small mess to practice sweeping. When you're done, choose different work."

EXTENSIONS

Once they can sweep well:
- They sweep up after art projects
- They sweep up after snack if they drop food
- Sweeping outside (bigger broom, bigger area)
- Sweeping leaves (if you have outdoor space)

REAL TALK

This is one of those activities where you have to let go and let it be messy at first. Yes, it's faster if you just sweep. But the point is THEY learn to do it.

I've seen 3-year-olds sweep better than some adults after a few weeks of practice. They take it seriously if you show them it's real work, not a toy.

Also kids LOVE to sweep during cleanup time. Everyone wants the broom. Have multiple. Trust me.

ASSESSMENT

Kid is successful when:
- Can sweep a small area without scattering mess everywhere
- Can use dustpan to collect the pile
- Puts tools away properly
- Chooses sweeping when they see a mess (without being asked)
