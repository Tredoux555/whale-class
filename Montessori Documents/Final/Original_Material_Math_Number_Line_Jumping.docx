THE BASIC IDEA

A number line (0-20) taped on the floor. Kids jump from number to number while counting. Makes counting physical instead of just verbal.

Simple but surprisingly effective.

---

WHY I MADE THIS

Had several kids who could rote count (memorize 1,2,3,4,5...) but didn't really understand what the numbers meant. Especially the concept of "one more" or "one less."

Also had kids with lots of physical energy who needed to MOVE. This combines movement with math.

Got the idea from a workshop but adapted it for my classroom.

MATERIALS NEEDED

- Colored tape (I used blue painters tape)
- Large number cards 0-20 (or you can write directly on the tape)
- Floor space about 3 meters long
- Laminating sheets (if using cards)

---

HOW TO MAKE IT

1. Find a clear floor area (hallway works, or corner of classroom)

2. Put down tape to make squares/circles on floor, spaced about 20cm apart

3. Number them 0 through 20 (I started with 0-10, added 11-20 later)

4. Either:
   - Write numbers directly on tape with permanent marker, OR
   - Laminate number cards and tape them down

5. Make sure tape is stuck down really well - kids will be jumping on it

Total cost: $8 (tape + laminating supplies)
Time: 30 minutes

HOW TO USE IT (PRESENTATION)

**BASIC VERSION (counting)**

1. Stand at number 0 with child
2. "Watch me count by jumping."
3. Jump to 1, say "ONE"
4. Jump to 2, say "TWO"  
5. Continue through 10
6. Walk back to start
7. "Now you try."

**INTERMEDIATE VERSION (one more/one less)**

1. "Stand on number 5"
2. "Jump to one more. What number is that?" (6)
3. "Jump to one less. What number is that?" (4)
4. Practice this with different starting numbers

**ADVANCED VERSION (skip counting)**

1. "Let's count by 2s"
2. Jump to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
3. Or count by 5s: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20

WHAT I SEE IN MY CLASSROOM

This material gets used CONSTANTLY. Multiple kids every day want to "do the number line."

Kids who struggle with abstract counting suddenly get it when they can physically move through the numbers. Something about the body movement makes it click.

Also great for:
- High-energy kids who need to move
- Kinesthetic learners
- Kids who get bored with sitting math activities

---

VARIATIONS I'VE TRIED

**Backwards counting**: Start at 10, jump backwards to 0

**Two kids**: One calls out a number, other has to jump there

**Math problems**: Simple addition - "Start at 3, jump 2 more, where are you?" (5)

**Blindfolded**: For kids who've mastered it - can they count by feeling the spaces?

**Outside version**: Used chalk to make one on the playground - kids loved it

---

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

**Problem**: Kids jump past the spaces (too excited)  
**Solution**: Make them hop on one foot - slows them down

**Problem**: Traffic jam when multiple kids want to use it  
**Solution**: Set a timer - each kid gets 5 minutes

**Problem**: Tape coming up after a week  
**Solution**: Use better quality tape, re-stick edges daily

**Problem**: Kids just running back and forth not actually learning  
**Solution**: Teacher supervises first few times, then they can use it independently once they understand the purpose

MONTESSORI PRINCIPLES

Concrete to abstract: Physical movement represents abstract number concepts
Repetition: Kids naturally want to do it over and over
Self-correction: If they count wrong, they end up on the wrong number
Gross motor: Integrates body movement with learning

---

WHEN TO INTRODUCE

Prerequisites:
- Can count 1-10 verbally
- Recognizes numerals 1-10
- Has body control (can jump/hop on one foot)

Usually around age 4-4.5 years

---

ASSESSMENT

Kid is successful when:
- Counts accurately while jumping (numbers match movements)
- Can do "one more" and "one less" from any starting point
- Can find any number on the line without counting from the beginning
- Eventually: Can skip count by 2s, 5s, or 10s

---

EXTENSIONS

Once they master 0-20:
- Add numbers to 30, 50, or 100 (needs more floor space)
- Introduce negative numbers (go backwards from 0)
- Use for addition/subtraction: "Start at 7, subtract 3, where do you land?"
- Fractions: Add marks between whole numbers for halves

---

REAL TALK

This was super easy to make. Took me half an hour. But it's one of the most used materials in my classroom.

Sometimes the simplest ideas work best. You don't need fancy expensive materials. Blue tape and a marker = effective math lesson.

---

PARENT CONNECTION

I sent photos home of kids using this. Parents loved seeing their kids literally jumping into math. Several asked how to make one at home (it's even easier with a hallway and some tape).
