LESSON: SPONGING / TABLE WASHING

Teacher: Tredoux Willemse
Area: Care of Environment  
Age: 2.5 - 4 years

---

MATERIALS

- Small bucket or bowl
- Water
- Sponge (cut to child hand size - not a full adult sponge)
- Small towel for drying
- Tray to hold everything

---

AIMS

Kids learn to clean up after themselves. Specifically:
- Wipe down tables after meals or art projects
- Clean up spills
- Take care of the classroom

This is one of the most practical practical life exercises. We actually need this done every day.

THE LESSON

1. INVITE  
"Would you like to learn how to wash a table?"

2. SETUP  
Bring materials to a table. Fill bowl about halfway with water. Place bowl, sponge, and towel on tray on the table.

3. DEMONSTRATION  
Pick up sponge. Dip it in water. Squeeze it so it's damp, not dripping.

Wipe the table in smooth strokes. Start at one end, work across, don't miss spots. Show them how to rinse the sponge in the bowl when it gets dirty.

When table is wiped down, take the towel. Dry the table with the same smooth strokes.

Put dirty water bowl aside (show them where to dump it - usually in sink). Return tray to shelf.

4. THEIR TURN  
Set up fresh materials. Let them wash the table.

5. OBSERVE  
Watch but don't interfere. They'll probably:
- Use too much water (sponge dripping everywhere)
- Miss sections of the table
- Not squeeze the sponge enough

That's all fine. They're learning. After they finish you can say "Good job! Next time try squeezing the sponge like this" and show them again.

COMMON ISSUES

**Water everywhere** - they love water. They'll make a huge mess at first. I just keep towels nearby and we mop it up together. Part of learning.

**Not actually cleaning** - just moving water around. Show them how to put pressure on the sponge. "Press down and wipe."

**Can't wring out sponge** - hand strength issue. It's okay, they'll build that muscle over time. Or use a lighter sponge.

---

WHEN TO USE THIS

- After lunch/snack (kids wash their table)
- After art projects (clean up paint, glue, etc.)
- Random spills during work cycle
- Scheduled cleaning day (we do "classroom care" every Friday)

---

VARIATIONS

Start simple: One table, water only
Then add: Soap (tiny amount)
Then: Different surfaces (shelves, chairs, windows)
Eventually: Bigger areas, outdoor tables

REAL CLASSROOM BENEFITS

This is one of those things where kids actually contribute to the classroom functioning. They're not practicing for future life - they're doing real work RIGHT NOW that needs to be done.

That's empowering for them. "I can take care of my space."

Plus it saves me a lot of work. If 20 kids can each wash their own table area after lunch... that's 20 fewer tables I have to wash.

---

EXTENSION IDEA

Some of my older kids (5-6 years) become "table monitors." They check all the tables after meal times and wash any that are still dirty. They take it very seriously. Give them a clipboard and everything.

---

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- Child can wet sponge properly (damp not dripping)
- Wipes entire surface systematically
- Rinses sponge when dirty
- Dries table after washing
- Cleans up materials when done
- Eventually: Does this automatically after meals without being asked
