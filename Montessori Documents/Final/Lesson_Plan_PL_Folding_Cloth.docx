THE PRESENTATION

1. Get child, bring basket to table

2. Take out one cloth, lay it flat on table. Smooth it out with your hands. This part is important - show them how to make it flat and neat.

3. Fold in half - bring bottom edge up to meet top edge precisely. Line up the corners. Smooth it flat.

4. Fold in half again - bring left edge to meet right edge. Line up corners again. Smooth it flat.

5. Place folded cloth in basket.

6. Take out second cloth. Repeat the whole process.

7. Hand a cloth to the child. "Now you try."

8. Watch them do it. Don't fix it immediately if it's not perfect. Let them finish their fold. Then you can say "let's try again and really match the corners" and demonstrate once more.

9. Let them fold all the cloths in the basket.

10. When done, show them where basket goes on the shelf.

KEY TEACHING POINTS

- Match corners precisely (this is the main skill)
- Smooth the cloth after each fold (builds good habits)
- Work slowly and carefully (not rushing through it)

---

WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS

First attempts are messy. The corners don't match. The cloth is bunched up instead of flat. That's completely normal.

Don't expect perfection on day one. This takes weeks of practice.

Some kids get frustrated. If they're getting upset, just do it together - "I'll hold this corner, you hold that corner, now we bring them together." Make it collaborative, not a test.

VARIATIONS

Once they've got the basic fold:
- Fold into thirds instead of halves
- Fold different shaped cloths (rectangle towels)
- Fold napkins for snack setup
- Fold their own smock after art time
- Eventually: fold their own clothes (pajamas for nap time)

EXTENSIONS FOR OLDER KIDS

Some 5-year-olds in my class can fold fitted sheets. I'm not kidding. If you show them the technique (using the corners) they can do it. It's actually impressive.

REAL CLASSROOM NOTES

I use this activity a LOT during work cycle. It's calming. Good for kids who are too wound up - give them the folding basket, they sit and fold for 10 minutes, they regulate.

Also it's practical. We actually need cloth napkins folded for snack time. So they're doing real work, not fake practice work.

Pro tip: Get cloths that are the same color or have a clear front/back difference. Makes it easier to see if they're folding correctly.

SUCCESS INDICATORS

Child can:
- Fold a square cloth in half with corners mostly matched
- Smooth the cloth after folding
- Complete the task without constant help
- Return materials to proper place
- Eventually: fold without a demonstration each time
