PART 3: CONSTRUCTION STEPS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: PREPARE WOODEN TILES
• Cut 20 tiles from wood (5cm x 5cm x 0.5cm each)
• Sand all edges and surfaces until smooth
• Round corners slightly with sandpaper for safety
• Wipe clean of all sawdust

STEP 2: CREATE QUANTITY TILES (0-9)
• Lightly pencil guide marks for dot placement on 10 tiles
• Use red acrylic paint to create dots (8mm diameter)
• Use standard dice/domino patterns for arrangement
• Tile 0 remains blank (represents zero/empty set)
• Allow paint to dry completely (24 hours)

STEP 3: CREATE NUMERAL TILES (0-9)
• Lightly pencil center lines on remaining 10 tiles
• Write numerals 0-9 using black permanent marker (3cm tall)
• Ensure numerals are centered and legible
• Numerals should match style used in classroom (sans-serif recommended)

STEP 4: SEAL TILES
• Apply 2-3 coats of clear wood sealant to all tiles
• Allow drying time between coats (per sealant instructions)
• This protects paint/ink and allows for easy cleaning

STEP 5: FINISH TILES
• Attach small felt pads to bottom of each tile
• This prevents scratching and noise during use
• Test tiles on work surface to ensure smooth movement

STEP 6: PREPARE STORAGE TRAY
• Sand tray if needed
• Apply wood sealant or paint if desired (optional)
• Ensure compartments are clean and appropriately sized
• Label or mark divider if helpful for organization

STEP 7: QUALITY CHECK
• Verify all tiles are identical in size
• Check that dots are clear and evenly painted
• Ensure numerals are legible and correctly formed
• Confirm all tiles fit properly in storage tray
• Test that tiles can be easily grasped and manipulated

• Remove all quantity tiles, placing them in random order on right side of mat
• Set empty tray aside

PART C: DEMONSTRATION (Three Period Lesson Format)

FIRST PERIOD: NAMING

Step 5: Introduce Small Set (Start with 0, 1, 2)
• Place numeral "0" in work area
• Point to it and say: "This is zero"
• Place quantity tile (blank) next to it
• Point to it and say: "This is zero - no dots, nothing"
• Slide them together to make a pair

Step 6: Continue with 1 and 2
• Repeat process with numeral "1" and quantity (one dot)
• Repeat process with numeral "2" and quantity (two dots)
• Now three pairs are visible

SECOND PERIOD: RECOGNITION

Step 7: Test Understanding
• Mix up the three quantity tiles
• "Can you find two?" (child points or selects)
• "Can you find zero?" (child responds)
• "Can you find one?" (child responds)
• Repeat several times with variations

THIRD PERIOD: RECALL

Step 8: Assess Recall
• Point to quantity tile with two dots: "How many is this?"
• Point to blank tile: "How many is this?"
• Point to tile with one dot: "How many is this?"

PART D: INDEPENDENT MATCHING PRACTICE

Step 9: Child's Turn (Limited Set)
• Separate the three pairs again
• "Now you match the numbers with their quantities"
• Child works to match all three pairs
• Observe without interrupting

Step 10: Verification
• Once child finishes: "Let's check your work together"
• Review each pair: "Two dots... and the number 2. That matches!"
• Celebrate accuracy; gently correct any errors by modeling

PART 6: ASSESSMENT & OBSERVATION GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READINESS INDICATORS:

Child is ready for this material when they demonstrate:
□ Can count objects 1-10 accurately
□ Recognizes numerals 0-9
□ Shows interest in matching activities
□ Can work independently for 10+ minutes
□ Understands concept of zero (empty set)

MASTERY INDICATORS:

Child has mastered this material when they can:
□ Correctly match all 10 pairs without assistance
□ Identify any quantity 0-9 by sight (subitizing)
□ Name any numeral 0-9 on sight
□ Complete matching in under 3 minutes
□ Work without checking each match multiple times
□ Self-correct any errors independently

OBSERVATION CHECKLIST:

During work, observe for:
□ Concentration span (aim for 10-15 minutes)
□ Self-correction behavior
□ Confidence level (does child seem sure or hesitant?)
□ Fine motor control (tile handling)
□ Verbal counting or silent work
□ Systematic approach vs. random matching
□ Frustration tolerance if errors occur
□ Pride in completed work

COMMON ERRORS & RESPONSES:

Error: Confusing 6 and 9
Response: "Let's check this numeral. The round part of the 9 is on top, like a balloon floating up. The round part of the 6 is on the bottom, like a ball on the ground."

Error: Miscounting dots on quantity tiles
Response: Don't point out error immediately. After all matching is done: "Let's check your work by counting together." Count dots together for mismatched tile. "How many did we count? What number should match?"

Error: Loses interest after few tiles
Response: Reduce set size. "Let's work with just five pairs today. You can do more tomorrow!"

PART 7: PARENT COMMUNICATION GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS WORK TO PARENTS:

"Your child is working with the Number Memory Matching Game. This material helps them connect the quantity they see (dots) with the symbol they read (numeral). It's like when we see three apples, we know that's the number '3' - this game practices that connection. Strong quantity-numeral association is essential for all future math learning, including addition, subtraction, and even multiplication."

WHAT PARENTS CAN DO AT HOME:

□ Play "I Spy" with numbers: "I spy a number 4 on the clock!"
□ Count real objects and write the numeral: "Five cookies... let's write a 5"
□ Use playing cards (Ace through 9) for matching quantities to numbers
□ Point out numbers in daily life (addresses, prices, page numbers)
□ Avoid flashcard drilling - keep it playful and contextual

RED FLAGS TO WATCH:

If child shows these signs, may need additional support:
• Consistent reversal of 6 and 9 after repeated practice
• Inability to count objects past 5 accurately
• No recognition of any numerals despite practice
• Extreme frustration or avoidance of number work
→ Consider vision screening, additional one-to-one practice, or consultation with early childhood specialist

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 8: MAINTENANCE & CARE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAILY MAINTENANCE:
• Wipe tiles with damp cloth if needed
• Ensure all tiles are returned to proper compartment
• Check that tiles are not chipped or damaged

WEEKLY MAINTENANCE:
• Deep clean tray and all tiles
• Verify all 20 tiles are present
• Replace any damaged tiles
• Check felt pads on tile bottoms

LONG-TERM CARE:
• Re-seal tiles annually if paint shows wear
• Touch up any faded numerals or dots
• Sand and refinish wooden tray as needed
• Store in dry location (avoid humidity which can warp wood)

EXPECTED LIFESPAN:
With proper care, this material should last 5-10 years of classroom use.

TEACHER REFLECTION NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Why I Created This Material:
I noticed several children in my class had mastered Number Rods and Sandpaper Numbers but still showed hesitation when connecting quantity to symbol in new contexts. They needed more practice in a game format that felt less formal than traditional math materials. This matching game provides that bridge - it's engaging, self-correcting, and can grow with the child through variations and extensions.

Challenges Encountered:
Initially, I didn't include zero in the set. After observing children's work, I realized the blank tile representing zero was crucial for complete understanding of the number system. The tray organization also required adjustment - separating quantities from numerals with a divider reduced confusion during cleanup.

Future Improvements:
I may create a second set with different quantity representations (tally marks, ten frames, or actual objects) to further develop flexible number sense. The current dot pattern is excellent but could be supplemented with additional visual formats.
