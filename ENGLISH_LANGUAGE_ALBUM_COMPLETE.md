# ⚠️ CRITICAL AMI CLARIFICATION

## The Pink/Blue/Green Series Is NOT From Maria Montessori

**Important:** The color-coded Pink, Blue, and Green Series—though ubiquitous in Montessori schools—**was NOT prescribed by Maria Montessori and is NOT part of official AMI training**.

This system was developed by Montessori teachers as an organizational convenience. The authentic AMI elements are:
- **Sound Games (I Spy)**
- **Sandpaper Letters**
- **Moveable Alphabet**
- **Metal Insets**
- **Grammar Work**

We include the Pink/Blue/Green system in this album because it's practical and widely used, but you should know it's a modern organizational tool, not AMI canon.

## Key AMI Principle: WRITING Before READING

Children learn to WRITE (encode) before they READ (decode). The moveable alphabet enables expression through written symbols before fine motor skills are ready for pencil control.

# 🇨🇳 ESL ADAPTATIONS FOR MANDARIN SPEAKERS

## Phonological Challenges Chinese Learners Face

### Consonants NOT Present in Mandarin

| English Sound | Chinese Substitution | Example Error | Teaching Focus |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| /θ/ (thin) | [s] | "think" → "sink" | Tongue between teeth |
| /ð/ (this) | [z] | "this" → "zis" | Voiced version |
| /v/ | [w] | "village" → "willage" | Teeth on lip |
| Dark L (pool) | [ə] vowel | "pool" → "poor" | Back of tongue |
| Consonant clusters | Added vowels | "post" → "poster" | Blend practice |

### Vowel Challenges (CRITICAL)
- Chinese has only **5 vowels** versus English's 15+
- No long/short vowel distinction — "ship" and "sheep" confusion
- Diphthong difficulties — "bide/bad/bed" confusion
- Research: **Negative transfer occurs primarily with VOWELS, not consonants**

### Suprasegmental Challenges
- Chinese uses **lexical tone**; English uses **stress-timing**
- Chinese learners produce "choppy" speech with equal syllable timing
- Word linking absent — each word pronounced separately

## Modified Phonics Sequence for Mandarin Speakers

### Phase 1 — Familiar Sounds (Pinyin Transfer) ✅
s, m, t, p, b, f, n, l (initial position), k, g, h
*These 18 consonants transfer positively from Pinyin knowledge.*

### Phase 2 — Modified Familiar Sounds
r (different articulation), l (final position), consonant clusters

### Phase 3 — New Sounds Requiring Explicit Instruction
/θ/ and /ð/, /v/, long/short vowel distinctions, dark L

## Modified Sandpaper Letter Grouping for Chinese L2 Learners

| Group | Letters | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 1 | s, a, t, m | Familiar from Pinyin |
| 2 | p, i, n, b | Familiar articulation |
| 3 | c/k, o, d, g | Voiced/voiceless focus |
| 4 | f, e, h, l | L in final position practice |
| 5 | r, u, w, j | R pronunciation focus |
| 6 | v, y, x, z, q | Problematic sounds LAST |

## Modified AMI Sequence for L2 Learners

| Standard AMI Sequence | L2 Adaptation |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Spoken Language Games | **Extended 6–12 months**; heavy use of real objects |
| I-Spy (sound games) | Begin only after strong oral vocabulary (**200–300 words**) |
| Sandpaper Letters | **Delay until age 4.5–5** for L2; present familiar sounds first |
| Moveable Alphabet | Focus on CVC words child can say and understand |
| Pink Series | **Vocabulary pre-teaching essential**; smaller word sets |
| Blue Series | May combine with Green for L2 learners |
| Green Series | **Earlier introduction** of th, sh, ch (critical for English) |

## Grammar Considerations for Chinese Learners

**Chinese lacks morphological inflection** — this creates persistent challenges:

| English Feature | Chinese Equivalent | Teaching Implication |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Plural -s | Context/classifiers | Explicit instruction via grammar materials |
| Past tense -ed | Time words (昨天) | Extended verb work in grammar boxes |
| Third person -s | None | Consistent modeling and practice |
| Articles a/an/the | **None** | Heavy emphasis in grammar presentations |

Research shows "morphological insensitivity" persists even at advanced levels. Grammar symbol work should include **extended presentations on plurals, tenses, and articles**.

## Bilingual Classroom Setup: OPOL Approach

**One Person-One Language (OPOL) is most effective:**
- English teacher speaks ONLY English with children
- Chinese teacher speaks ONLY Chinese
- Child associates each language with specific person

### Time Allocation by Age

| Age | L1 (Chinese) | L2 (English) | Focus |
|-----|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 3–4 | 80–90% | 10–20% | Oral exposure, songs, vocabulary |
| 4–5 | 70% | 30% | English sandpaper letters, vocabulary building |
| 5–6 | 60% | 40% | Reading/writing introduction, structured English Corner |

# CATEGORY 1: ORAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

## Work 1.1: Sound Games ("I Spy") ⭐ ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

### 📚 Purpose
Train the ear to isolate individual sounds within words. This is the **FOUNDATION** of all reading. As AMI trainer Muriel Dwyer emphasized: "The aim is to make children aware of the sounds they use in speech... without ANY reference to the sandpaper letters."

**Sound Games must be completed ENTIRELY before introducing any written symbols.**

### 👶 Readiness Signs
- Child has vocabulary of 100+ words (200-300 for L2 learners)
- Can name common objects
- Shows interest in language play
- Age 2.5-3.5 years (L1) or 3.5-4.5 years (L2)

### 🛒 Materials Needed

| Item | 1688 Search (VERIFIED) | English Search | Qty | Notes |
|------|------------------------|----------------|-----|-------|
| Sound basket objects | `蒙氏语言教具 字母发音物品配对` | "Montessori phonics objects miniatures" | 1 set | 3-5 objects per letter |
| Small sorting baskets | `木质分类篮 蒙氏` | "wooden sorting basket Montessori" | 3-6 | Natural materials |
| Miniature animals | `仿真动物模型 迷你 儿童认知` | "miniature animal figures educational" | 1 set | Realistic, not cartoon |
| Miniature objects | `仿真食品模型 迷你` | "miniature food models realistic" | 1 set | Various beginning sounds |

**⚠️ SOURCING NOTE:** True Safari Ltd-style language miniatures are rare on 1688. Best alternatives:
- Nienhuis Montessori (premium)
- Montessori Outlet (mid-range)
- Aliexpress "Montessori language miniatures"

### 🎯 Presentation: The Six Stages

**Stage 1: Single Object (Beginning Sounds)**

Hold one object (e.g., a cat figurine). Say:

```
"I spy with my little eye something in my hand 
that begins with /k/."
```

Make it **impossible to fail**. Child names the object.

**Stage 2: Two Contrasting Objects**

Place two objects with **distinctly different** beginning sounds (not similar sounds like /b/ and /d/). Child selects the correct one.

**Stage 3: Multiple Objects (3-6)**

Increase difficulty gradually. Add descriptive clues:

```
"I spy something you can wear that starts with /h/."
```

**Stage 4: Ending Sounds**

```
"I spy something that ENDS with /t/."
```

**Stage 5: Beginning AND Ending**

```
"I spy something that starts with /f/ and ends with /sh/."
```
(fish)

**Stage 6: All Sounds (Segmenting)**

```
"Can you tell me ALL the sounds in the word 'cat'?"
```

Child responds: "/k/ /a/ /t/."

### ⚠️ Critical Sound Production

**SAY THE SOUND, NOT THE LETTER NAME**

| Letter | ✅ CORRECT | ❌ WRONG |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| b | /b/ (quick puff) | "bee" or "buh" |
| c | /k/ (quick) | "see" |
| d | /d/ (quick) | "dee" |
| f | /fff/ (continuous) | "eff" |
| g | /g/ (quick) | "jee" |
| m | /mmm/ (continuous) | "em" |
| s | /sss/ (continuous) | "ess" |
| t | /t/ (quick) | "tee" |

**Consonant sounds must be PURE — no added "uh"**

### 🇨🇳 L2 Adaptation
- Begin with sounds that transfer from Pinyin: s, m, t, p, b, f, n
- Use objects with Chinese equivalents child knows: 猫 (cat), 苹果 (apple)
- Spend extra time on /θ/, /ð/, /v/ sounds before introducing those letters
- Can play in small groups for peer modeling

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Child can identify beginning sound 8/10 times
- Child spontaneously says "That starts with /m/!"
- Child enjoys the game and asks to play
- Ready for sandpaper letters when mastering all six stages

### 🔄 Extensions
- Walk around classroom: "I spy something that begins with /d/..."
- Outdoor I Spy during nature walks
- Name games: "Whose name begins with /m/? Marcus! /m/-Marcus!"
- Can be played informally — in car, waiting rooms, transitions

```

### 🎯 Presentation: The Three-Period Lesson

**Stage 1: Picture Cards Only (Pre-reading)**

```
[Select 5-6 picture cards from one category, e.g., fruits]

"These are pictures of fruits. Let's look at them together."

[Lay out cards in a row]

PERIOD 1 - NAMING:
"This is an apple." [Point to card]
"This is a banana." [Point to card]
"This is an orange." [Point to card]

PERIOD 2 - RECOGNITION:
"Show me the banana."
"Point to the apple."
"Put the orange by the window."

PERIOD 3 - RECALL:
[Point to orange] "What is this?"
```

**Stage 2: Matching Labels (Early Reading)**

```
[After child knows sandpaper letters and is starting to read]

"Now let's match the words to the pictures."

[Lay out picture cards]
[Give child one label card]

"Can you read this word?"
[Child sounds out: /a/-/p/-/l/ = apple]

"Where does it go?"
[Child places under apple picture]

"Let's check with the control card."
[Compare - child self-corrects if needed]
```

### 🇨🇳 L2 Adaptation
- Use bilingual cards initially (English word + 中文)
- Focus on high-frequency, concrete nouns first
- Categories that translate well: animals, fruits, body parts, clothing
- **Essential categories for L2:** farm animals, transportation, classroom objects

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Child names all pictures in a set accurately
- Child independently matches labels to pictures
- Child uses control cards to self-correct



---

# CATEGORY 2: WRITING PREPARATION

## Work 2.1: Metal Insets ⭐ ESSENTIAL

### 📚 Purpose
Develop the fine motor control needed for handwriting BEFORE asking children to form letters. The Metal Insets develop:
- Pincer grip
- Hand muscle strength
- Lightness of touch
- Every type of line needed for English alphabet letters

**All tracing is COUNTERCLOCKWISE** to prepare for handwriting.

### 👶 Readiness Signs
- Child can hold a pencil with proper grip
- Shows interest in drawing/coloring
- Can focus for 10-15 minutes
- Age 3-4 years typically

### 🛒 Materials Needed

### 🎯 The Seven Presentations (AMI Complete Sequence)

**Presentation 1: Single Frame with Horizontal Lines**

```
[Carry tray to table with two hands]

"Today I'm going to show you how to use the metal insets."

[Place frame in center of paper, holding with left hand]

"I hold the frame steady with this hand."

[With pencil in right hand, place tip at starting point]

"I start here..."

[Trace COUNTERCLOCKWISE around the INSIDE of the frame, 
keeping pencil touching the edge at all times]

"...and I go all the way around, keeping my pencil 
touching the edge... slowly... all the way around... 
until I come back to where I started."

[Remove frame]

"Now I fill it with lines going this way."

[Draw horizontal lines LEFT TO RIGHT, evenly spaced]

"Would you like to try?"
```

**Presentation 2: Frame in Two Positions**
- Trace frame in one color
- Rotate frame to different position
- Trace again in different color
- Creates overlapping design

**Presentation 3: Frame and Inset Together**
- Trace frame (color 1)
- Place inset inside frame
- Trace around OUTSIDE of inset (color 2)
- Creates border effect

**Presentation 4: Frame with Different Inset**
- Use frame of one shape
- Use inset of different shape inside
- Creates overlapping geometric patterns

**Presentation 5: Creative Patterns**
- Multiple frames and insets combined
- Various color combinations

**Presentation 6: Full Creativity**
- Larger paper
- Artistic designs
- Child-directed exploration

**Presentation 7: Grading/Pressure Control**
- Shade from dark to light
- Varying pencil pressure
- Prepares for shading and writing pressure

### Key Points
- Should be done **DAILY** for fine motor development
- Model correct posture: both feet on floor, back against chair
- All movements from left to right
- All tracing counterclockwise

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Lines stay on the edge of the frame
- Pencil grip is correct (tripod)
- Parallel lines are evenly spaced
- Child can control pencil pressure

---

## Work 2.2: Sandpaper Letters ⭐ THE CORNERSTONE

### 📚 Purpose

### 👶 Readiness Signs
- **MUST have mastered I Spy (all six stages)**
- Can isolate beginning, middle, and ending sounds
- Shows interest in letters
- Age 3.5-4.5 years (L1) or 4.5-5 years (L2)

### Board Colors (AMI Standard)
- **PINK boards** = Consonants
- **BLUE boards** = Vowels
- **GREEN boards** = Phonograms (sh, ch, th, ee, oa, etc.)

### Letter Introduction Order

**Most Useful Letters First — enables word building quickly:**

| Group | Letters | Why These |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | s, a, t, m | High-frequency, distinct sounds/shapes |
| 2 | c, r, i, p | Enables many CVC words |
| 3 | n, o, b, h | Expands word possibilities |
| 4 | d, g, f, l | Fills gaps |
| 5 | k, e, u, w | More vowels, useful consonants |
| 6 | j, y, v, x, z, q | Less common |

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **NEVER** introduce letters that look similar together (b/d, m/n, p/q)
- **NEVER** introduce letters that sound similar together
- **Include one vowel** in each early lesson
- **Introduce a phonogram by the fourth presentation**

### 🎯 Presentation: The Three-Period Lesson (AMI Script)

**Preparation:**
- Choose THREE letters (2 consonants + 1 vowel)
- Letters should look and sound DIFFERENT
- Sit at table, child to your non-dominant side
- Stack letters face-down in upper right
- Sensitize fingertips by rubbing together

**PERIOD 1: NAMING ("This is...")**

```
[Turn over first letter - let's say 'm' - place in front of child]

[Making personal connection:]
"Remember when we were saying names that start with /m/? 
Your friend Ming! Ming starts with /mmm/. 
I'm going to show you what the /m/ sound looks like."

[Place your index and middle fingers TOGETHER at the 
starting point of the letter]

[Trace the letter SLOWLY, exactly as you would write it]

[AFTER completing the trace, say the sound:]
"/mmm/"

[Trace again, then say:]
"/mmm/"

[Trace a third time, then say:]
"/mmm/"

"Would you like to trace it?"

[Child traces and says sound. If incorrect, simply model again]

"Let's think of more words that begin with /mmm/..."

[Pause, thinking expression]

"/mmm/... /mmm/-moon! Moon!"
"/mmm/... /mmm/-monkey!"

[Move letter to upper left corner]

[Repeat with second and third letters]
```

**PERIOD 2: RECOGNITION ("Show me...")**

This is where **MOST learning occurs**. Spend the most time here.

```
[Place all three letters randomly in front of child]

"Show me the letter that says /m/."

[Child points to or touches letter]

"Yes! Trace it and tell me its sound."

[Vary the requests to maintain engagement:]

"Put the /s/ by the window."
"Give me the /a/."
"Can you put /m/ on your head?"
"Hide the /s/ under your hands."
"Trace the /a/ with your eyes closed."

[If child chooses wrong letter:]
- DO NOT say "No" or "Wrong"
- Simply say: "This one says /m/. Feel it with me."
- Return to Period 1 if needed
```

**PERIOD 3: RECALL ("What is this?")**

Only attempt when 100% confident child knows the sounds.

```
[All letters face down. Flip one:]

"What sound does this letter make?"

[Child says sound]

"Yes! Can you trace it?"

[If child cannot recall, return to Period 2]
```

**Control of Error:** The sandpaper texture itself — if fingers slip off, child notices the different surface feeling.

### Critical Sound Production Guide

| Letter | ✅ CORRECT | ❌ WRONG |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| b | /b/ (quick puff, lips together then apart) | "bee" or "buh" |
| d | /d/ (tongue behind top teeth, quick) | "dee" or "duh" |
| f | /fff/ (top teeth on bottom lip, continuous) | "eff" |
| g | /g/ (back of throat, quick) | "jee" |
| k | /k/ (back of throat, quick) | "kay" |
| l | /lll/ (tongue behind top teeth, continuous) | "ell" |
| m | /mmm/ (lips together, continuous, voiced) | "em" |
| n | /nnn/ (tongue behind top teeth, continuous, voiced) | "en" |
| p | /p/ (lips together then apart, quick puff) | "pee" |
| r | /rrr/ (tongue curled back, continuous) | "arr" |
| s | /sss/ (teeth together, continuous) | "ess" |
| t | /t/ (tongue behind top teeth, quick) | "tee" |
| v | /vvv/ (top teeth on bottom lip, continuous, voiced) | "vee" |
| w | /w/ (lips rounded then spread) | "double-u" |
| z | /zzz/ (teeth together, continuous, voiced) | "zee" |

### Phonogram Introduction: START EARLY!

**Young children learn "sh" = one sound just as easily as "s" = one sound. Don't delay phonograms!**

| Phonogram | Sound | Key Words | When to Introduce |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| sh | /sh/ | ship, shop, fish | After 4-6 single letters |
| ch | /ch/ | chin, chop, rich | After 4-6 single letters |
| th | /th/ (voiced) | this, that, then | **CRITICAL for L2** |
| th | /th/ (unvoiced) | thin, thick, thank | **CRITICAL for L2** |
| oo | /oo/ (long) | moon, food, cool | Early-middle |
| oo | /oo/ (short) | book, look, cook | Early-middle |
| ee | /ee/ | see, tree, bee | Early-middle |
| ai | /ay/ | rain, train, paint | Middle |
| oa | /ow/ | boat, coat, goat | Middle |

### 🇨🇳 L2 Adaptation for Sandpaper Letters

**For Mandarin speakers, reorder letter introduction:**

| Group | Letters | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 1 | s, a, t, m | Familiar from Pinyin |
| 2 | p, i, n, b | Familiar articulation |
| 3 | c/k, o, d, g | Voiced/voiceless focus |
| 4 | f, e, h, l | L in final position practice |
| 5 | r, u, w, j | R pronunciation focus |
| 6 | v, y, x, z, q | **Problematic sounds LAST** |

**Additional L2 focus:**
- Introduce th, sh, ch phonograms **EARLIER** than standard sequence
- Spend extra time on /v/ vs /w/ distinction
- Practice consonant clusters explicitly
- Use mirror to show mouth position for difficult sounds

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Child traces with correct finger formation (index + middle together)
- Child says sound AFTER completing trace (not during)
- Child can identify letter by touch alone (eyes closed)
- Child spontaneously connects letters to words
- Child asks "What letter does ___ start with?"

### 🔄 Extensions
- Sand tray writing (trace letter from memory)
- Eyes-closed identification game
- Letter hunt around the classroom
- Making letters with playdough
- Writing letters in shaving cream
- Pairing with moveable alphabet work

# CATEGORY 3: WORD BUILDING

## Work 3.1: Moveable Alphabet ⭐ ESSENTIAL

### 📚 Purpose
Enable children to BUILD words before their hands are ready to write them. The moveable alphabet separates the **intellectual act of composing** from the **physical act of writing**.

**Key AMI Principle:** Writing (encoding) comes BEFORE reading (decoding).

### 👶 Readiness Signs
- Child recognizes 3-4 consonant sounds plus one vowel
- Has worked extensively with Sandpaper Letters
- Can blend sounds orally ("What word is /c/-/a/-/t/?")
- Age 4-5 years typically

### 🛒 Materials Needed

| Item | 1688 Search (VERIFIED) | English Search | Est. Price | Notes |
|------|------------------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Moveable Alphabet Box | `蒙氏活动字母箱` or `语言区活动字母箱` | "Montessori moveable alphabet box" | ¥80-200 | 26 compartments |
| Large Moveable Alphabet | `蒙氏大号活动字母` | "large moveable alphabet" | ¥100-180 | For beginners |
| Small Moveable Alphabet | `蒙氏小号活动字母` | "small moveable alphabet" | ¥60-100 | For fluent children |
| Felt-lined mat | `蒙氏工作毯 绿色` | "Montessori work mat green" | ¥30-60 | Or use plain felt |

**Sample verified listing:**
"蒙氏教具蒙台梭利早教声母韵母认知教玩具幼儿园语言区活动字母箱"

### Color Coding
- **BLUE** = Vowels
- **RED** = Consonants

(Some systems reverse this — consistency matters more than which color)

### 🎯 Lesson 1: Orientation to the Box

```
[Demonstrate carrying box carefully with two hands]

"This is the Moveable Alphabet. It has all the letters we need 
to make words."

[Open box, place lid underneath]

[Take out a letter child knows - e.g., first letter of their name]

"Here's the /m/. Just like on the sandpaper letter!"

[Show how to find the correct compartment]

"When we're finished, each letter goes back in its home."

[Demonstrate returning letter - alphabetically, top-left to 
bottom-right. This prepares for reading direction.]

"Would you like to take out a letter you know?"
```

### 🎯 Lesson 2: Matching with Sandpaper Letters

**Bridge to abstraction:**

```
[Place 3-4 sandpaper letters child knows on the mat]

"Can you find the matching letters in the box?"

[Child finds corresponding moveable alphabet letters]

[Place wooden letter on top of sandpaper letter]

"They're the same! They both say /m/."

[Child traces sandpaper letter, then handles wooden letter]
```

### 🎯 Lesson 3: Building CVC Words (Main Presentation)

```
[Place a small object on the mat - e.g., a toy cat]

"Today we're going to SPELL some words!"

"What is this?"

[Child: "A cat."]

"Cat! Let's build the word 'cat.'"

"Say 'cat' slowly... what sound do you hear FIRST?"

[Child produces /k/ sound]

"Yes! /k/. Can you find the letter that makes /k/?"

[Child finds 'c', places on mat to the left of object]

"Perfect! Say 'cat' again slowly... what sound in the MIDDLE?"

[Child produces /a/ sound]

"Yes! /a/. Find it!"

[Child finds 'a', places next to 'c']

"And what sound at the END of 'cat'?"

[Child produces /t/ sound]

[Child finds 't', places at end]

"You spelled CAT! /k/-/a/-/t/... CAT!"

[Run finger under the word left to right as you blend]
```

### Word Building Progression

| Stage | Examples | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | CVC words with objects | cat, dog, pig, hat, cup |
| 2 | CVC words with pictures | Expands vocabulary |
| 3 | Two-word phrases | big cat, red hat |
| 4 | Simple sentences | The cat sat. |
| 5 | Stories | Short narratives |
| 6 | Dictation | Child writes what teacher says |

### CVC Words for First Work (Easy Blending)

**Short A words:** cat, hat, mat, sat, bat, bag, rag, can, man, pan, cap, tap, map

**Short E words:** bed, red, fed, hen, pen, ten, jet, net, pet, leg, beg

**Short I words:** pin, tin, win, pig, big, bit, hit, sit, kid, lid, dip, tip

**Short O words:** cot, dot, hot, lot, pot, dog, fog, hog, mop, hop, top, box, fox

**Short U words:** bun, fun, gun, run, sun, bug, dug, hug, cup, pup, cut, nut

### 🇨🇳 L2 Adaptation
- Focus on CVC words child can **say and understand**
- Pre-teach vocabulary with three-part cards before spelling
- Use objects with Chinese equivalents: 猫 (cat), 狗 (dog), 帽子 (hat)
- Smaller word sets than L1 learners
- More repetition of each word

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Child can segment words into individual sounds
- Child independently selects correct letters
- Child places letters left to right
- Child can read back what they've built
- Child shows pride in "writing"

### 🔄 Extensions
- Building words from memory (no object)
- Building words from pictures
- Building rhyming word families
- Building simple sentences
- Story writing

### 👶 Readiness Signs
- Mastery of Blue Series
- Fluent with blends
- Age 5-7 years typically

### The 16 Key Phonograms

| Phonogram | Sound | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **ch** | /ch/ | chair, cheese, lunch, beach |
| **sh** | /sh/ | ship, shell, fish, wish |
| **th** | /th/ voiced | this, that, then, with |
| **th** | /th/ unvoiced | thin, think, thank, bath |

### 🇨🇳 L2 Adaptation for Phonograms
- **th** phonograms are CRITICAL — Chinese has no equivalent
- Practice with mirror to show tongue position
- **Introduce th, sh, ch EARLIER** than standard sequence
- /r/-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, or, ur) need explicit practice

# CATEGORY 5: GRAMMAR

## The AMI Approach to Grammar

Grammar in Montessori is learned through **experiential games BEFORE abstract symbols**. Children understand the FUNCTION of words through physical activities, then associate those functions with symbols.

## The Grammar Symbols

| Part of Speech | Symbol | Color | Story/Reason |
|----------------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Noun** | Large equilateral triangle ▲ | Black | Pyramids — oldest, strongest human structures that NAME things |
| **Article** | Small triangle ▲ | Light blue | Part of noun family, but smaller role |
| **Adjective** | Medium triangle ▲ | Dark blue | Describes noun, part of noun family |
| **Verb** | Large circle ● | Red | Like the sun — gives energy to sentences |
| **Adverb** | Small circle ● | Orange | Part of verb family, modifies verb |
| **Preposition** | Semicircle/bridge ◠ | Green | Connects words like a bridge |
| **Pronoun** | Isosceles triangle ▲ | Purple | Takes the place of noun |
| **Conjunction** | Ribbon/bar — | Pink | Connects phrases together |
| **Interjection** | Exclamation point ! | Gold | "King of all words" — stands alone |

### 🛒 Materials Needed

| Item | 1688 Search (VERIFIED) | English Search | Est. Price | Notes |
|------|------------------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Grammar Symbols (wooden) | `蒙氏语法符号 木质` | "Montessori grammar symbols wooden" | ¥40-100 | 3D solid symbols |
| Grammar Symbols (flat) | `蒙氏平面语法符号` | "Montessori flat grammar symbols" | ¥25-60 | For older children |
| Grammar Boxes | `蒙氏语法盒` | "Montessori grammar boxes" | ¥150-300 | Set of 8 boxes |
| Sentence Analysis Charts | `蒙氏句子分析图` | "Montessori sentence analysis" | ¥50-100 | For older children |
| Farm Set | `蒙氏语法农场` | "Montessori grammar farm" | ¥100-200 | For function games |

## Work 5.1: The Noun (Function of Words Game)

### 📚 Purpose
Introduce the concept that NOUNS are "naming words" through a physical, experiential game.

### 🎯 Presentation: The Farm Game

```
[Set up miniature farm on a mat with various objects: 
cow, pig, sheep, farmer, tractor, barn, fence, etc.]

"These things all have NAMES. Can you tell me what this is?"

[Child names objects as you point: "cow," "pig," "sheep"]

"Words that NAME things are called NOUNS."

"A noun is a NAMING word."

[Write labels on small slips of paper]

"This says 'cow.'" [Place label next to cow]

"This says 'pig.'" [Place label next to pig]

"Can you match the rest?"

[Child places remaining labels]

[Introduce the black triangle symbol]

"Nouns have their own special symbol — this black triangle."

"Why do you think it's a triangle? 
Triangles are the strongest shape — like pyramids! 
And nouns are very important — they NAME our world!"

[Place small black triangle above each label]
```

---

## Work 5.2: The Verb (Command Game)

### 📚 Purpose
Introduce VERBS as "action words" or "doing words" through physical commands.

### 🎯 Presentation: The Command Game

```
[Write a verb on a slip of paper: "jump"]

"I have a secret message for you. Can you read it?"

[Child reads: "jump"]

"Can you DO what it says?"

[Child jumps]

"Yes! 'Jump' is an ACTION word. It tells you what to DO."

[Write several more verbs: run, hop, spin, clap, sit]

[Child reads and performs each action]

"Words that tell us what to DO are called VERBS."

[Now try the contrast:]

"Can you bring me the 'jump' from the farm?"

[Child is confused — you can't bring 'jump']

"Ah! 'Jump' isn't a thing we can hold. 
It's something we DO. That's the difference between 
nouns and verbs!"

[Introduce red circle symbol]

"Verbs have their own symbol — this red circle."

"Why red? Because verbs are like the SUN — 
they give ENERGY to our sentences!"
```

---

## Work 5.3: The Adjective (Detective Game)

### 📚 Purpose
Introduce ADJECTIVES as words that describe nouns and help us know WHICH ONE or WHAT KIND.

### 🎯 Presentation: The Detective Game

```
[Have several similar objects available: 
big book, small book, red book, green book]

"Please bring me a book."

[Child brings any book]

"Hmm, that's not the one I wanted."

"Bring me another book."

[Child brings different book]

"No, that's not it either! I want THAT one."

[Point to specific book]

"You don't know which one I want! 
I need to give you more information."

"Please bring me THE RED book."

[Child brings correct book]

"Yes! 'Red' told you WHICH book I wanted."

"Words that DESCRIBE nouns are called ADJECTIVES."

"Adjectives tell us WHICH ONE or WHAT KIND."

[More examples:]
"Bring me the BIG cow."
"Bring me the WOODEN fence."
"Bring me THREE eggs."

[Introduce dark blue medium triangle]

"Adjectives have this symbol — a blue triangle."

"It's a triangle because adjectives are part of the NOUN family.
But it's smaller because the adjective needs a noun to describe!"
```

---

## Work 5.4: The Article (A, An, The)

### 📚 Purpose
Introduce articles as small words that come before nouns.

### 🎯 Presentation

```
[Using the farm setup]

"'A' and 'the' are special little words."

"Listen: 'the cow' ... 'a pig' ... 'the barn'"

"These tiny words come before nouns."

"'A' means any one — 'a pig' could be any pig."

"'THE' means a specific one — 'THE pig' means 
that particular pig right there."

[Write labels: a cow, the pig, a barn]

[Child matches to objects]

"These little words are called ARTICLES."

[Introduce small light blue triangle]

"Articles have this tiny triangle — 
they're part of the noun family, but the smallest!"
```

### 🇨🇳 L2 Adaptation: Articles

**CRITICAL FOR CHINESE LEARNERS:** Chinese has no articles. This requires **extended practice**.

Activities to reinforce articles:
- Sort pictures: "a ___" vs "the ___"
- Spot the missing article in sentences
- Daily practice identifying articles in reading
- Article matching games

---

## Work 5.5: Grammar Boxes

### 📚 Purpose
Systematic practice with each part of speech using sentence cards and fill-in activities.

### The Eight Grammar Boxes

| Box | Color | Focus | Example Cards |
|-----|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Black | Article + Noun | the cow, a pig, an egg |
| 2 | Dark Blue | Adjective | the big cow, a small pig |
| 3 | Red | Verb | The cow runs. The pig eats. |
| 4 | Purple | Pronoun | He runs. She jumps. They play. |
| 5 | Green | Preposition | on the table, under the chair |
| 6 | Orange | Adverb | runs quickly, speaks softly |
| 7 | Pink | Conjunction | and, but, or, because |
| 8 | Gold | Interjection | Wow! Oh! Hurray! |

### How to Use Grammar Boxes

```
[Open Box 2 - Adjectives]

[Take out sentence card: "The ___ dog runs."]

"Can you read this sentence?"

[Child reads, noticing the blank]

"Something is missing! What kind of dog?"

[Spread out adjective word cards: big, small, brown, happy]

"Choose a word to fill the blank."

[Child selects "brown"]

"The brown dog runs. Perfect!"

"Now place the grammar symbols above each word."

[Child places: small blue triangle (the), 
medium blue triangle (brown), 
large black triangle (dog), 
red circle (runs)]
```
