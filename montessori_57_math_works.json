      {"step": 1, "title": "Introduction to Length", "description": "Invite child to explore the rods. Place the shortest rod (1 unit) on the mat. Discuss how long it is. Introduce 'short' and 'long' concepts through sensorial exploration.", "tip": "Use descriptive language: 'This rod is very short. This rod is very long.'"},
      {"step": 2, "title": "Pairing Rods by Length", "description": "Show the child two rods. Ask which is longer. Have them place rods side by side to compare. Repeat with different pairs, mixing short and long rods.", "tip": "Use natural language: 'Can you find the rod that is longer than this one?'"},
      {"step": 3, "title": "Building a Sequence", "description": "Demonstrate arranging rods from shortest to longest. Place the 1-rod, then find the rod that is longer. Continue sequentially. Name each position: 'This is the longest rod. This is the second longest.'", "tip": "Create the sequence slowly, emphasizing the progression. This is the foundation for understanding quantity."},
      {"step": 4, "title": "Counting Units in Each Rod", "description": "Once the sequence is complete, touch each rod while counting its segments. 'One, two, three...' Associate the length with the quantity of units.", "tip": "Emphasize that the rod's length directly represents the number of units it contains."},
      {"step": 5, "title": "Child's Independent Exploration", "description": "Invite the child to arrange rods themselves. Observe their understanding of sequence and quantity. Provide minimal guidance unless they request assistance.", "tip": "Allow errors. The control of error (visual) will help the child self-correct."}

    "points_of_interest": ["The contrast in length between rods", "The visual pattern when arranged in sequence", "The physical sensation of lifting heavier rods", "The satisfaction of creating order", "The connection between length and quantity"],
    "control_of_error": "Visual: The sequence is obvious when arranged correctly. A rod in the wrong position will visually stand out. The graduated length progression makes errors self-evident.",

    "parent_description": "Number Rods are long wooden rods of increasing length from 1 to 10 units. Your child learns to arrange them from shortest to longest, which helps them understand that quantity (numbers 1-10) is directly connected to physical length. This sensorial experience is the foundation for all future math learning.",
    "why_it_matters": "This material bridges the gap between sensorial learning and abstract number concepts. Children develop an intuitive understanding of quantity through physical manipulation before encountering symbols. The visual progression creates a mental template for quantity that supports all subsequent mathematical thinking."

Trace slowly, counting if appropriate. Repeat several times.", "tip": "Model the correct directional tracing. This proprioceptive input prepares for writing."},
      {"step": 3, "title": "Naming the Numeral", "description": "As the child traces, say the name: 'This is two. Two.' Repeat the name while tracing. Eventually, ask the child to say the name while tracing.", "tip": "Repetition through multiple sensory channels strengthens memory and symbol recognition."},

We have two objects.' Create the connection explicitly.", "tip": "Use materials familiar to the child (counters, beads, or everyday objects)."},

Observe their formation of letter shapes and their confidence with symbol naming.", "tip": "Allow the child to work at their own pace. Some children need weeks to internalize numerals."}
