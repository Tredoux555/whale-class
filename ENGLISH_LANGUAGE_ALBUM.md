# INTRODUCTION & PHILOSOPHY {#introduction}

## The Montessori Approach to Language

Maria Montessori discovered that children have a natural, sensitive period for language acquisition between ages 2-6. During this time, children absorb language effortlessly when given the right environment and materials.

### Key Principles

**Writing Before Reading:** Montessori observed that children naturally want to write before they read. Writing is analysis (breaking sounds into symbols), while reading is synthesis (combining symbols into meaning). Children find analysis easier.

**Phonetic Foundation:** We teach letter SOUNDS, not names. A child cannot read "cat" by saying "see-ay-tee" but CAN read it by blending /k/-/a/-/t/.

**Multi-Sensory Learning:** Every material engages multiple senses:
- **Visual:** Seeing the letter shape
- **Auditory:** Hearing the sound
- **Tactile:** Feeling the sandpaper texture
- **Kinesthetic:** Moving the hand in the letter pattern

**Isolation of Difficulty:** Each material focuses on ONE skill. Sandpaper letters teach sound-symbol correspondence. Metal insets teach pencil control. We don't combine difficulties.
