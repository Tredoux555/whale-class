## TOMORROW AT SCHOOL - QUICK ACTION PLAN

1. **During lunch/nap**: Record all 28 sounds (10 minutes)
2. **Export as MP3**: Use Voice Memos → Share → Save to Files
3. **Create folder**: whale/public/audio/phonemes/
4. **Copy files**: Drag all MP3s into the folder
5. **Test**: Run the app, click a game, see if sounds play

---

## IF SOMETHING BREAKS

The games will still work! Web Speech API is the fallback.
Just record when you can - no rush.

Good luck tomorrow! 🐋🎤
