## THE PHILOSOPHY

**Simple. Clean. Executable.**

This is NOT 1000 different works. This is the essential Montessori English progression as Maria designed it, adapted for Chinese ESL learners.

**The Three Phases:**
1. **Pre-Reading** (2.5-3.5) → Ears before eyes
2. **Encoding** (3.5-4.5) → Writing before reading
3. **Decoding** (4.5-6) → Reading emerges naturally

---

## SHELF RECOMMENDATION: 3 Units

**Why 3 shelves?**
- One shelf per phase
- Left-to-right progression (Montessori standard)
- Child can visually see their journey
- Clean, uncluttered, purposeful

**Shelf Specifications:**
- Width: 90-120cm each
- Height: 3-4 tiers per unit
- Depth: 30-40cm (fits trays)

**Room Placement:**
- Against a wall, away from high-traffic areas
- Natural light preferred (reading area nearby)
- Floor mat/rug space in front for work

---

## SHELF 1: PRE-READING (Ages 2.5-3.5)

*"Train the ear before the eye"*

### Top Tier: Sound Games Materials
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🧺 I-Spy Basket    🧺 I-Spy Basket    🧺 I-Spy Basket  │
│  (Beginning /m/)    (Beginning /s/)    (Beginning /a/)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What's in each basket:**
- 5-8 small objects starting with that sound
- Objects should be concrete, familiar, 3D
- Example /m/ basket: mouse, mug, mitten, moon, map, mat

**Rotation:** Start with 3-4 baskets, rotate weekly. Cover all 26 sounds over time.

**ESL Note for Chinese Learners:**
- START with sounds that exist in Mandarin: /m/, /n/, /s/, /l/, /f/
- DELAY difficult sounds: /v/, /th/, /r/ (these don't exist in Mandarin)
- Use extra objects for: /b/ vs /p/, /d/ vs /t/ (aspiration differences)

### Middle Tier: Sandpaper Letters
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📦 Box 1: a-i     📦 Box 2: j-r     📦 Box 3: s-z     │
│  (lowercase)       (lowercase)        (lowercase)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Organization:**
- Lowercase ONLY (uppercase comes much later)
- Vowels on BLUE backgrounds
- Consonants on PINK/RED backgrounds
- Stored in 3 boxes or a single compartmentalized tray

**Presentation Order (NOT alphabetical):**
1. Start with letters the child can HEAR in their name
2. Then visually distinct letters: c, m, a, t, s, r, i, p
3. Avoid similar letters together: b/d, p/q, m/n, u/v

**ESL Adaptation:**
- Spend EXTRA time on: v, th, r, l (phonemes absent in Mandarin)
- Connect to Pinyin where helpful: "This /s/ is like 's' in 'sī'"

### Bottom Tier: Metal Insets
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔷 Metal Insets Frame (10 shapes)                      │
│  📝 Paper Tray    ✏️ Colored Pencils    📋 Completed Work│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Setup:**
- Metal insets displayed in their wooden frame
- Stack of inset paper (14cm squares with frame line)
- Colored pencils in a holder (3-4 colors)
- Small tray for finished work

**Why here?** Metal insets prepare the hand for writing. The child traces shapes, building pencil control before letter formation.

---

## SHELF 2: ENCODING (Ages 3.5-4.5)

*"Writing before reading"*

### Top Tier: Large Moveable Alphabet
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔤 LARGE MOVEABLE ALPHABET BOX                         │
│  (Blue vowels, Red/Pink consonants, lowercase)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Specifications:**
- Letters: 5-7cm tall (large enough for small hands)
- Multiple copies of each letter (5+ vowels, 3+ consonants)
- Compartmentalized box with alphabet order
- Working mat that rolls out

**Key Principle:** Child builds words they can SAY but cannot yet READ. This is encoding - translating known sounds into symbols.

### Middle Tier: Object Boxes (Pink Series)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📦 CVC Objects    📦 CVC Objects    📦 CVC Objects     │
│  (a words)         (e words)         (i words)          │
│  cat, bat, map     bed, pen, net     pig, pin, kit      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What's inside each box:**
- 6-10 miniature objects (CVC words only)
- Objects must be concrete and recognizable
- Corresponding word cards (for later matching)

**CVC = Consonant-Vowel-Consonant** (cat, bed, pig, hot, cup)

**The 5 Object Boxes:**
1. Short /a/: cat, bat, map, hat, bag, pan, rat, van
2. Short /e/: bed, pen, net, jet, hen, web, leg, peg
3. Short /i/: pig, pin, kit, lip, wig, bib, fin, sit
4. Short /o/: pot, dog, log, mop, box, cot, fox, hop
5. Short /u/: cup, bug, rug, sun, bus, nut, jug, mud

### Bottom Tier: Picture-Word Matching
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📁 Picture Cards     📁 Word Cards      🧺 Matching    │
│  (CVC images)         (CVC words)        Basket         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Setup:**
- Picture cards (clear images, one per card)
- Corresponding word cards (same size, plain font)
- Small basket or tray for the activity
- Control card (picture + word together) for self-correction

---

## SHELF 3: DECODING (Ages 4.5-6)

*"Reading emerges naturally"*

### Top Tier: Pink Reading Cards
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📁 Pink Word       📁 Pink Phrase     📁 Pink Sentence │
│     Lists              Cards              Cards         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pink Series Progression:**
1. **Word Lists:** Single CVC words to decode
2. **Phrase Cards:** "a red cat" / "the big dog"
3. **Sentence Cards:** "The cat sat on the mat."
4. **Command Cards:** "Sit on the rug." (child reads and acts)
5. **Pink Readers:** Small decodable books (CVC only)

### Middle Tier: Blue Series Introduction
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📁 Blend Cards     📁 Blue Word       📁 Blue Phrase   │
│  (bl, cr, st...)    Lists              Cards            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Blue Series = Consonant Blends**

Beginning Blends: bl, cl, fl, gl, pl, sl, br, cr, dr, fr, gr, pr, tr, sc, sk, sm, sn, sp, st, sw

Ending Blends: -ck, -ft, -lk, -mp, -nd, -nk, -nt, -pt, -sk, -st

**Only introduce Blue when Pink is MASTERED** (child reads CVC fluently)

### Bottom Tier: Sentence Building
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📦 Grammar Symbols    📁 Sentence      📦 Story        │
│  (noun, verb, adj)     Building Cards   Sequencing      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Sentence Building Materials:**
- Word cards on colored backgrounds by part of speech
- Noun = black, Verb = red, Article = light blue, Adjective = dark blue
- Child physically builds sentences by arranging cards

```

**Flow Principles:**
1. Child moves LEFT → RIGHT through the shelves (natural progression)
2. Floor space in front of shelves for rug work
3. Reading nook nearby for comfortable book time
4. Materials return to EXACT same spot (order!)

## ESL ADAPTATIONS FOR CHINESE LEARNERS

### Sounds That Need Extra Attention

| English Sound | Challenge for Mandarin Speakers | Strategy |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------|
| /v/ | Doesn't exist in Mandarin | Pair with /f/, exaggerate lip position |
| /θ/ (th) | Doesn't exist | Use mirror, show tongue position |
| /r/ | Different from Mandarin r | Start with "er" sound they know |
| /l/ vs /r/ | Often confused | Explicit contrast activities |
| /b/ vs /p/ | Aspiration difference | Feel breath on hand |
| /d/ vs /t/ | Aspiration difference | Feel breath on hand |
| Final consonants | Often dropped | Emphasize ending sounds |

### Adaptation Strategies

1. **Sound Games First** - Spend MORE time on I-Spy than typical. Chinese learners need extra phonemic awareness training.

2. **Pinyin Bridge** - When helpful, connect English sounds to Pinyin: "This /s/ sound is like the 's' in sī (four)"

3. **Final Sounds Emphasis** - Mandarin has few final consonants. Use objects that emphasize endings: "cat" - really hear that /t/!

4. **Blend Work** - Mandarin is syllable-timed. English blends (bl-, str-) are challenging. Extra practice needed.

5. **Minimal Pairs** - Use object pairs that differ by one sound: bat/pat, bet/bed, pin/bin

---

## DAILY RHYTHM

### Morning Work Cycle (Suggested)

```
8:30-9:00   Free choice from all shelves
9:00-9:15   Small group Sound Games (I-Spy)
9:15-10:00  Free choice - encourage progression
10:00-10:15 Story time in Reading Nook
```

### Teacher's Role

1. **Observe** - Which shelf is each child drawn to?
2. **Present** - Give individual lessons when child is ready
3. **Connect** - "I see you know all the sounds! Let's try the Sandpaper Letters."
4. **Record** - Track which works each child has been presented/mastered

---

## READINESS INDICATORS

### Ready for Shelf 2 (Encoding) when child can:
- ✅ Identify beginning sounds in words consistently
- ✅ Identify ending sounds in words
- ✅ Trace sandpaper letters with correct formation
- ✅ Associate most letter sounds with symbols
- ✅ Show interest in "writing" words

### Ready for Shelf 3 (Decoding) when child can:
- ✅ Build CVC words with moveable alphabet
- ✅ Sound out words they've built
- ✅ Match objects to word cards
- ✅ Show interest in "reading" environmental print
- ✅ Blend sounds smoothly (not choppy: "c-a-t" → "cat")

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: What Goes Where

| Shelf | Tier | Materials |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Top | I-Spy Sound Baskets (3-6 rotating) |
| 1 | Middle | Sandpaper Letters (3 boxes, lowercase) |
| 1 | Bottom | Metal Insets + paper + pencils |
| 2 | Top | Large Moveable Alphabet |
| 2 | Middle | Object Boxes (5 boxes, CVC by vowel) |
| 2 | Bottom | Picture-Word Matching Cards |
| 3 | Top | Pink Reading Cards (words → phrases → sentences) |
| 3 | Middle | Blue Series (blends) |
| 3 | Bottom | Sentence Building + Grammar Symbols |

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Teaching alphabet order** - Montessori teaches by SOUND, not A-B-C
❌ **Uppercase first** - Always lowercase first (it's what they'll read)
❌ **Pushing reading before encoding** - Writing MUST come first
❌ **Skipping Sound Games** - The foundation for everything
❌ **Too many materials at once** - Keep it sparse and purposeful
❌ **Correcting during work** - Child self-corrects with control cards

---

## SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Phase 1 Success:**
- Child plays Sound Games independently
- Child traces letters while saying sounds
- Child shows interest in letter sounds everywhere

**Phase 2 Success:**
- Child builds words unprompted
- Child sounds out words they've built
- Child matches objects to words with control card

**Phase 3 Success:**
- Child reads CVC words fluently
- Child reads simple sentences
- Child picks up books and attempts to read
