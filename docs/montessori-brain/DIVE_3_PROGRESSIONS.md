# MONTESSORI BRAIN - DIVE 3: Progression Sequences
## Learning Pathways & Prerequisite Chains

> **Purpose**: Map complete learning pathways showing how works chain together
> **Created**: January 20, 2025
> **Status**: DIVE 3 Complete

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: EVERYTHING CONNECTS

The Montessori curriculum is not a collection of isolated activities - it's an **interconnected web** where:
- Each work builds on previous works (vertical progression)
- Areas prepare for other areas (horizontal connections)
- Sensorial experiences become abstract understanding
- Concrete materials transition to paper-based work

**The AI recommendation engine must understand these pathways to suggest appropriate next steps.**

## 3. SENSORIAL → MATHEMATICS CONNECTIONS

### 3.1 The Dimension Materials Thread

This is one of the most critical progressions in Montessori:

```
SENSORIAL                    MATHEMATICS
-----------                  -----------
Knobbed Cylinders           (Pincer grip, seriation)
     ↓
Pink Tower  ─────────────→  Cubing concept (1³ to 10³)
     ↓                           ↓
Brown Stair ─────────────→  Squaring concept (1² to 10²)
     ↓                           ↓
Red Rods ────────────────→  Number Rods (same dimensions!)
                                 ↓
                            Golden Beads
                                 ↓
                            Short/Long Bead Chains
                            (visual squares and cubes)
```

**Physical Connections:**
| Sensorial Material | Mathematical Preparation |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Pink Tower | 1cm³ to 10cm³ - introduces cubic progression |
| Brown Stair | Prisms increase by square numbers (1², 2², 3²...) |
| Red Rods | Identical to Number Rods but unpainted |
| Knobless Cylinders | Same dimensions as Knobbed, increased abstraction |
| Binomial Cube | (a+b)³ algebraic formula (sensorial in 3-6) |
| Trinomial Cube | (a+b+c)³ algebraic formula |

└── Sound Objects (objects starting with each sound)
```

**Key Insight**: Child must be able to isolate sounds BEFORE sandpaper letters.

### 4.2 Writing Before Reading

## 6. CROSS-AREA PREREQUISITE CHAINS

### 6.1 What Must Come First

```
FOR MATHEMATICS:
└── Practical Life (concentration, order, fine motor)

## 7. AI RECOMMENDATION LOGIC

### 7.1 Decision Tree for Next Work

```python
def recommend_next_work(child):
    # Step 1: Check sensitive periods active at this age
    active_periods = get_sensitive_periods(child.age)
    
    # Step 2: Get completed works
    completed = child.completed_works
    
    # Step 3: Find works where prerequisites are met
    available_works = []
    for work in all_works:
        if work.prerequisites_met(completed):
            if work.sensitive_periods_match(active_periods):
                available_works.append(work)
    
    # Step 4: Prioritize by area balance
    area_counts = count_by_area(completed)
    underserved_area = find_lowest_area(area_counts)
    
    # Step 5: Prioritize gateway works (unlock more works)
    gateway_works = find_gateway_works(available_works)
    
    # Step 6: Return top recommendations
    return prioritize_recommendations(
        available_works,
        underserved_area,
        gateway_works,
        active_periods
    )
```

### 7.2 Gateway Works (High Priority)

These works unlock many subsequent works and should be prioritized:

| Gateway Work | What It Unlocks |
|-------------|----------------|
| Cylinder Blocks | All dimension materials |
| Pink Tower | Brown Stair, advanced Sensorial |
| Red Rods | Number Rods, all Mathematics |
| Sound Games | All Language |
| Sandpaper Letters | Moveable Alphabet, all reading |
| Moveable Alphabet | Pink, Blue, Green Series |
| Number Rods | Decimal system, all advanced Math |
| Golden Bead Intro | All operations |

### 7.3 Sample Recommendation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New 3-year-old**
- Active Periods: Order, Movement, Sensorial
- Completed: None
- **Recommend**: Carrying tray, Rolling mat, Dry pouring, Cylinder Block 1

**Scenario 2: 4-year-old, strong Practical Life**

## 8. PARENT EXPLANATION TEMPLATES

### 8.1 Explaining Progressions

**For Transfer Activities:**
> "Your child is working with spooning activities. This isn't just about moving beans from one bowl to another - the three-finger grip used in spooning is the same grip they'll use to hold a pencil. Each transfer activity builds the hand strength and control needed for writing."

**For Sensorial → Math:**
> "The Pink Tower might look like simple stacking blocks, but each cube increases in a precise mathematical progression. When your child handles these cubes, they're developing an unconscious understanding of cubing (1³, 2³, 3³...) that will make sense when they encounter these concepts in mathematics later."

**For Writing Before Reading:**
> "In Montessori, children often write before they read. This may seem backwards, but it makes sense: writing is putting down what they already know (sounds), while reading is decoding something new (symbols). The Moveable Alphabet lets your child 'write' words without needing handwriting skills."
