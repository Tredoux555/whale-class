# MONTESSORI BRAIN - DIVE 2: Work-by-Work Analysis
## Complete Curriculum Mapping for Ages 2.5-6

> **Purpose**: Map every Montessori work to sensitive periods, prerequisites, and developmental purposes
> **Created**: January 20, 2025
> **Status**: DIVE 2 Complete

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: THE PROGRESSION LOGIC

Every Montessori work exists within a carefully sequenced progression. Each work:
- Builds on previous works (prerequisites)
- Addresses specific sensitive periods
- Develops specific skills (direct aims)
- Prepares for future work (indirect aims)
- Has observable readiness indicators

The AI recommendation system uses this mapping to suggest appropriate next works based on:
1. Child's age and active sensitive periods
2. Completed works (prerequisites met)
3. Observable behaviors (readiness indicators)
4. Balance across curriculum areas

---

## 8. AI RECOMMENDATION LOGIC

### 8.1 Recommendation Algorithm

```
INPUT: Child's age, completed works, observed behaviors
OUTPUT: Recommended next works (3-5 works)

1. Identify active sensitive periods based on age
2. Filter works by:
   - Prerequisites met (from completed works)
   - Age-appropriate
   - Sensitive period alignment
3. Prioritize by:
   - Unmet prerequisites for desired works
   - Balance across curriculum areas
   - Sensitive period intensity
4. Return top 3-5 recommendations with:
   - Work name
   - Direct/indirect aims
   - Parent-friendly explanation
   - Expected duration
```
