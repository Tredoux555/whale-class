  "sessionSummary": {
    "whatWeDid": [
      "1. Identified issues: 'a' had descending tail like 'q', 'h' looked like 'n', 'g' went off screen",
      "2. Deep research on correct Montessori stroke order from 6+ authoritative sources",
      "3. Created comprehensive stroke guide for all 26 lowercase letters",
      "4. Rewrote ALL lowercase SVG paths with correct coordinates",
      "5. Increased canvas from 250x250 to 300x300 for better fit",
      "6. Updated uppercase paths to match new canvas size",
      "7. Build passed successfully"

      "Letters that match the Sass Phonics font shown in header",
      "Correct educational stroke order for 3-4 year olds",
      "Proper ascenders: b,d,f,h,k,l,t reach TOP line (y=40)",
      "Proper descenders: g,j,p,q,y extend below baseline (y=260) but stay ON screen",
      "All letters fit properly in canvas - no clipping",

  "nextStepsAfterDeploy": [
    "1. Verify all 26 lowercase letters display correctly",
    "2. Check 'h' has tall stem reaching top",
    "3. Check 'g' descender stays on screen",
    "4. Check 'a' has no descending tail",
    "5. Test on tablet for touch accuracy",
    "6. If any issues, fine-tune individual paths"
