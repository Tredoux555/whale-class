  "fixesApplied": {
    "b": "Changed to CONTINUOUS: down from top, retrace up, around clockwise - no M in middle",
    "f": "Adjusted hook position, smoother curve",
    "g": "Fixed descender to y=255 (stays on screen), hook connects properly",
    "h": "Made CONTINUOUS: down, retrace up, hump - no M in middle",
    "j": "Adjusted descender to y=255, improved hook",
    "k": "Split into 3 strokes: stem, diagonal in, diagonal out (correct formation)",
    "m": "Changed to DOWN FIRST: start at top, down, retrace up, hump, down, retrace, hump, down - CONTINUOUS",
    "n": "Changed to DOWN FIRST: start at top, down, retrace up, hump, down - CONTINUOUS",
    "p": "Made CONTINUOUS: down to descender, retrace up, around clockwise",
    "q": "Fixed connection: circle flows into descender smoothly, tail at y=255",
    "r": "Changed to DOWN FIRST: start at top, down, retrace up, curve right - CONTINUOUS",
    "t": "Adjusted starting position",
    "u": "Added final downstroke on right side - now goes down, curve, up, DOWN",
    "w": "Adjusted middle point for better shape",
    "y": "Adjusted positions for cleaner look"
  },

  "strokeOrderPrinciple": "All vertical strokes go TOP to BOTTOM (down first, then retrace up if needed)",
