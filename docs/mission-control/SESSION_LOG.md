# WHALE SESSION LOG

## How This Works
Every session, Claude reads this + mission-control.json to understand where we are.
Every session end, Claude updates both files.
This is the brain. New thoughts get added here.

## 2026-01-07 Session 2

### Context
User reported SwipeableWorkRow issues:
1. Horizontal swipe was moving the whole page (not native feel)
2. Dropdown panel (swipe-down gesture) wasn't working reliably

Also requested English Guide alignment check.

### What We Fixed

1. **SwipeableWorkRow Native Feel** (`/app/admin/classroom/SwipeableWorkRow.tsx`)
   - Added `touch-action: pan-y` - tells browser "you handle vertical scroll, I handle horizontal"
   - Changed dropdown from swipe-down gesture to **tap toggle** (much more reliable)
   - Tap the work name OR the chevron arrow to open/close panel
   - Added hint text "← swipe →" so users know they can swipe works
   - Better swipe detection (1.5x horizontal ratio threshold)
   - Cleaner 150ms transitions

2. **Language Curriculum Alignment** (`/lib/curriculum/data/language.json`)
   - Compared English Guide (8 stages, 37 skills) with language.json
   - Found gap: Sound Blending and Sound Segmenting were in English Guide but NOT in curriculum
   - **Fixed:** Added Level 5 (Sound Blending) and Level 6 (Sound Segmenting) to la_sound_games
   - Added Elkonin boxes and counters/chips to materials list
   - Sound Games now has 7 levels matching all skills

### Alignment Summary

| English Guide Skill | Curriculum Level | Status |
|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| Beginning sounds | Level 1-2 | ✅ |
| Ending sounds | Level 3 | ✅ |
| Middle sounds | Level 4 | ✅ |
| Sound blending | Level 5 | ✅ ADDED |
| Sound segmenting | Level 6 | ✅ ADDED |
| Sound boxes | Level 7 | ✅ |

### Commits
- `17c3f6b` - fix: SwipeableWorkRow - native feel with touch-action, tap to toggle panel
- `e2bb103` - fix: add Sound Blending and Segmenting to language curriculum (align with English Guide)

### Files Changed
- `/app/admin/classroom/SwipeableWorkRow.tsx` - Native touch handling, tap-to-toggle
- `/lib/curriculum/data/language.json` - Added blending/segmenting levels

## 2026-01-07 Session 1

### Context
Classroom page UI improvements requested - swipe gestures and notes functionality

### What We Did

1. **Updated SwipeableWorkRow component** (`/app/admin/classroom/SwipeableWorkRow.tsx`)
   - Removed permanent 📷 and ▶️ buttons from each row
   - Added **swipe-down gesture** to reveal action panel with:
     - 📝 Notes text input (auto-saves to database with debounce)
     - 📷 Photo button
     - 🎥 Video button 
     - ▶️ Demo button
   - Kept swipe-left/right for changing works in curriculum sequence
   - Added 📝 indicator on row when notes exist
   - Notes save to `weekly_assignments.notes` column (already exists in DB)

2. **Curriculum Audit** - Created `/docs/mission-control/CURRICULUM_AUDIT.md`
   - Reviewed all 5 curriculum JSON files against montree structure
   - **RESULT: All curriculum data is correctly structured**
   - Practical Life: 8 categories, ~80 works ✅
   - Sensorial: 8 categories, ~45 works ✅
   - Math: 9 categories, ~70 works ✅
   - Language: 5 categories, ~60 works ✅ (aligned with English Guide stages)
   - Culture: 7 categories, ~70 works ✅
   - If order appears wrong in UI, issue is display logic not data

3. **Updated classroom page** to pass `onNotesChanged` callback to SwipeableWorkRow

4. **Comprehensive Audit** - Created `/docs/mission-control/AUDIT_REPORT_JAN7.md`
   - Fixed SwipeableWorkRow: removed dead code, added cleanup, added notes sync
   - Fixed Sound Games: corrected audio paths from `/audio/` to `/audio/ui/`
   - All 5 sound games verified working with speech synthesis fallback
   - Audio files documented: UI sounds exist, phonemes need recording

### UI Change Summary
**Before:** Each work row had permanent 📷 and ▶️ buttons
**After:** Clean rows with swipe-down to reveal notes input + action buttons

### Files Changed
- `/app/admin/classroom/SwipeableWorkRow.tsx` - Fixed dead code, added cleanup, added notes sync, added onRecordVideo prop
- `/app/admin/classroom/page.tsx` - Added onNotesChanged prop
- `/lib/sound-games/sound-utils.ts` - Fixed audio paths to `/audio/ui/`
- `/docs/mission-control/CURRICULUM_AUDIT.md` - New file
- `/docs/mission-control/AUDIT_REPORT_JAN7.md` - New comprehensive audit

## 2026-01-06 Session 3 (COMPLETE)

### Context
- Railway build was failing
- Area ordering inconsistent across pages
- Over-engineered school/classroom system wasn't working

### What We Did
1. **Fixed Railway build** - Supabase client was initializing at module level (build time = no env vars)
   - Fixed `/api/admin/students/[studentId]/route.ts`
   - Fixed `/api/admin/students/[studentId]/report/route.ts`
   
2. **Standardized area order** - PL → Sensorial → Math → Language → Culture
   - `/app/admin/classroom/[childId]/page.tsx`
   - `/app/admin/classroom/page.tsx`
   - `/lib/montree/types.ts` (AREA_ORDER constant)
   - `/app/admin/montree/components/ProgressSummary.tsx`

3. **MAJOR CLEANUP** - Deleted 1,864 lines of broken code:
   - `/classroom-view/*` (broken standalone)
   - `/admin/schools/*` (unused)
   - `/admin/classrooms/*` (unused)
   - `/admin/students/*` (orphaned)
   - Related API routes

4. **Simple multi-school** - Added school_id to children, 4 school slots ready
   - Created `/api/schools` endpoint
   - Added school selector to `/admin/classroom`
   - Ran migration `004_simple_schools.sql` - 22 children linked to Beijing Intl

5. **Created mission-control brain** - This file + mission-control.json + MASTER_PLAN.md

### Commits (all pushed)
- `d234744` - feat: standardize area display order
- `5a0a9d6` - cleanup: remove over-engineered school/classroom hierarchy  
- `38c2fc1` - feat: add multi-school support (4 schools)
- `e377bea` - feat: create mission-control brain for Whale
- `957293f` - feat: add Sound Games (purely auditory phonics)

### Key Decisions
- NO nested hierarchy (schools → classrooms → children)
- YES simple flat structure (schools → children directly)
- School selector only shows when >1 school has children

## Reading Guide for New Claude Sessions

1. Read `mission-control.json` for current state
2. Read latest session in this file for context
3. Check what's pending
4. Ask Tredoux what's next

The goal: Every Claude instance picks up exactly where we left off.
