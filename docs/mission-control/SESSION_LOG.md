## SESSION 45: Digital Handbook v2 - Deep Audit (Jan 22, 2026)

### 🎯 THE MISSION
Build the Digital Handbook - a browsable reference of all 213 Montessori works from the Brain database. Then deep audit and improve.

### ✅ DELIVERED

**Files Created:**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------||
| `/admin/handbook/page.tsx` | Landing - 6 area cards with dynamic counts |
| `/admin/handbook/[areaId]/page.tsx` | Area view with filters, modals |

**Deep Audit Improvements (v1 → v2):**
| Issue Found | Fix Applied |
|-------------|-------------|
| Hardcoded work counts | Now dynamic from API |
| No gateway badges | Added 🌟 Gateway Work markers |
| No age filter | Added age toggle (2.5-5.5) |
| No sequence numbers | Added to work list |
| Sub-areas alphabetical | Now Montessori-ordered |
| No typical age | Added age_typical display |
| Missing philosophy | Added area intro text |
| No 3 Master Threads | Added visual on landing |
| No sensitive periods ref | Added 11 periods display |

**UI Features:**
- Dynamic work counts from API
- Age filter (2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5)
- Gateway works filter
- Collapsible sub-area groups
- Sequence numbers
- Search within area
- Modal with direct/indirect aims, materials, readiness

**Prepared for Future API Joins:**
- Prerequisites section (needs `/api/brain/works` to join `work_prerequisites`)
- Unlocks section (needs join to `work_unlocks`)
- Sensitive period badges (needs join to `work_sensitive_periods`)

### 📊 PHASE 1 TEACHER TOOLS: COMPLETE

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| English Guide | ✅ 1859 lines teaching methodology |
| English Setup | ✅ 3-shelf diagram, ~550 words |
| Digital Handbook | ✅ Browse 213 works with filters |

### ⏭️ WHAT'S NEXT (Priority Order)

**Quick Wins (30 min - 1 hour):**
1. Update `/api/brain/works` to join prerequisites, unlocks, sensitive_periods
2. Handbook modal automatically shows all data

**High Impact (2-3 hours):**
1. Add AI Suggestions panel to weekly planning
2. Map 20 games to Brain works
3. Parent portal progress reports

**Infrastructure (half day):**
1. Real DB connection for school hierarchy
2. Unified progress sync across tools

---

## SESSION 44: English Setup Complete (Jan 21, 2026)

### Delivered
- `/admin/english-setup` - 3-shelf visual diagram with click-to-reveal modals
- ~550 practical word lists (trimmed from 1500+)
- Print material links in each modal

---

## SESSION 36: Montessori Brain Research Complete (Jan 20, 2025)

### 🧠 THE MISSION
Build the AI-powered curriculum intelligence system that enables Whale to make smart recommendations based on child's age, completed works, and active sensitive periods.

### 📚 RESEARCH COMPLETED (5 DIVEs)

| DIVE | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Scientific foundation, 11 sensitive periods, 4 planes of development | ✅ |
| 2 | 270+ works catalogued with aims, prerequisites, readiness indicators | ✅ |
| 3 | Learning pathways, prerequisite chains, gateway works identified | ✅ |
| 4 | Cross-area connections, skill transfers, multi-purpose materials | ✅ |
| 5 | Database schema, SQL functions, AI prompts, TypeScript integration | ✅ |

**Total Research:** ~51,000 words across 5 documents

### 🔍 KEY DISCOVERIES

1. **Red Rods = Number Rods** - Physically identical, only color markings differ
2. **Pink Tower = Cubing** - Cubes are 1³ to 10³ (sensorial → mathematical)  
3. **Writing before Reading** - Encoding (what child knows) before decoding (new info)
4. **Three-finger grip** - Spooning grip IS pencil grip
5. **No subject boundaries** - Every work serves multiple developmental purposes

### 📦 DATABASE READY

Created two migration files:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `040_montessori_brain.sql` | 6 tables, indexes, RLS, recommendation functions |
| `041_montessori_brain_seed.sql` | 11 sensitive periods, 30 gateway works, prerequisites |

**Tables:**
- `sensitive_periods` - 11 developmental windows
- `montessori_works` - Curriculum materials with full metadata
- `work_prerequisites` - Required/recommended prerequisites
- `work_sensitive_periods` - Work-to-period mappings with relevance scores
- `work_cross_benefits` - Cross-area benefits
- `work_unlocks` - What each work prepares for

**Functions:**
- `get_available_works(child_age, completed_work_ids)` - Works child is ready for
- `get_recommended_works(child_age, completed_work_ids, limit)` - AI-scored recommendations

## SESSION 35 CONTINUED: THE STEM Architecture (Jan 15, 2026 - 21:40)

### 🌱 THE STEM Philosophy

**`/admin/schools/beijing-international`** is THE STEM - the single source of truth.
- Everything grows from here
- "If this goes down for even a day, we lose the school forever"
- Build step by step, only what's needed - maximum efficiency
- Tesla style: energy direct from source to output

### Access Control
- **ACTIVE NOW:** Tredoux only (Owner)
- **INACTIVE:** Jasmine, Ivan (will activate later)

### What I Built

**School Dashboard (THE STEM)** now has 3 tabs:
1. **Classrooms** - Shows Whale Class with 18 students
2. **Teachers** - Tredoux (active), Jasmine (inactive), Ivan (inactive)
3. **Tools** - All access points in one place:
   - 📝 Weekly English Reports (highlighted - most used)
   - 🔤 English Progression
   - 📚 Curriculum
   - 👶 Student Progress (links to classroom)
   - ⚙️ Settings

**Classroom Page** - Updated with real students:
- 18 Whale Class students in exact order from your report
- Shows current English work for each child
- Quick links to Reports, English Sequence, Curriculum

### 18 Students with Current Progress (from Week 17 report):
| # | Name | Current Work |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | Rachel | WFW /e/ |
| 2 | Yueze | WFW /o/ |
| 3 | Lucky | WFW /i/ |
| 4 | Austin | WFW /e/ |
| 5 | Minxi | WBW 3ptc /e/ |
| 6 | Leo | WBW 3ptc /e/ |
| 7 | Joey | WBW Mixed Box 1 |

| 15 | Hayden | WBW 3ptc |
| 16 | KK | WBW /a/ |
| 17 | Kayla | I Spy games |
| 18 | Stella | I Spy games |

### Routes from THE STEM
```
/admin/schools/beijing-international          → THE STEM (main dashboard)
/admin/schools/beijing-international/classrooms/whale → Student list
/admin/schools/beijing-international/english-reports  → Weekly reports
/admin/schools/beijing-international/english          → English sequence
/admin/schools/beijing-international/curriculum       → Montessori works
```

### Next: Wire to Database
When ready, run migrations to persist this data:
- `039_whale_class_correct_order.sql` - Creates 18 students with display_order
- `038_english_reports_complete.sql` - English works + progress tracking
