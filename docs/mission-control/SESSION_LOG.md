## SESSION 8 - January 11, 2026

### CHECKPOINT 1 - Production Fix
**Issue:** Production 404s - build failing on Railway
**Root cause:** Multiple route files creating Supabase client at module level

**Files fixed:**
1. `/app/api/admin/lesson-documents/route.ts` ✅
2. `/app/api/lesson-documents/delete/route.ts` ✅
3. `/app/api/lesson-documents/list/route.ts` ✅
4. `/app/api/lesson-documents/upload/route.ts` ✅

**Fix pattern:** Changed from module-level `const supabase = createClient(...)` to lazy `function getSupabase() { return createClient(...) }`

**Commits:**
- `ebd5bab` - First fix (admin/lesson-documents)
- `5a25486` - Remaining 3 files

**Status:**
- ✅ Local build passed (229 pages)
- ✅ Pushed to Railway
- ⏳ Waiting for Railway deploy...
