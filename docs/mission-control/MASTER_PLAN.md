# WHALE MASTER PLAN

## The Vision

Whale is not just a classroom tool. It's the education backbone for the Jeffy Schools mission.

**Every school funded by Jeffy Commerce will run on Whale.**

When a merit-selected student walks into a Jeffy School on Tredoux's family farm, their teacher uses Whale to:
- Track their Montessori progress
- Plan their week
- Report to their family
- Document their journey

This is the system that proves education done right.

## Current Reality (Jan 2026)

**1 school, 22 kids, Beijing International**

Tredoux uses this daily with his kindergarten class. Real usage, real feedback, real iteration.

---

## Phase 1: Perfect for One (NOW)

- [x] Weekly planning (Chinese docs → Claude → Grid view)
- [x] Classroom progress tracking
- [x] Montree curriculum tree
- [x] Teacher tablet interface
- [x] Photo/video capture per child
- [ ] Sound games (auditory phonics)
- [ ] Parent reports (AI-generated)
- [ ] Parent view portal

---

## Phase 2: Scale to Four (Q1 2026)

4 school slots ready. When Tredoux moves to Qingdao or onboards another school:
- Update placeholder to real school
- Add children with new school_id
- School selector appears automatically

No code changes needed. Just data.

---

## Phase 3: Franchise Model (Future)

- Each school gets their own slug: `teacherpotato.xyz/beijing`, `teacherpotato.xyz/qingdao`
- School admins manage their own teachers/children
- Super admin (Tredoux) sees everything
- Curriculum stays centralized (Montree)

---

## Phase 4: Jeffy Schools Integration (Future)

When Jeffy Commerce funds the first school:
- Whale becomes the official LMS
- Progress data feeds into community reporting
- Parents see child growth via app
- Transparent education outcomes

---

## Design Principles

1. **Teacher-first** - If it doesn't help the teacher, delete it
2. **Works offline** - Classrooms have bad wifi (PWA support)
3. **One tap** - Progress tracking = one tap, not three screens
4. **Montessori native** - Not adapted from traditional ed-tech
5. **Simple > Clever** - We just deleted 1,864 lines of "clever" code

---

## Technical Philosophy

- Claude writes ALL code
- Cursor copies, never generates
- Supabase for data
- Railway for hosting
- Handoff files for continuity

---

## Success Metrics

- Tredoux uses it daily without bugs
- Second school onboards in < 1 hour
- Parents understand their child's progress
- Teachers say "this saves me time"

---

## The Long Game

Whale proves that technology can serve education without corporate bloat.

When Jeffy Schools opens, students learn on a platform built by a teacher who used it himself.

That's the story. That's the mission.
