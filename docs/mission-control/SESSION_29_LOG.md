## Presentation Audit & Polish

**Started:** ~07:00 Beijing
**Goal:** Ensure Jan 16 demo is impressive

## CHUNK 1: Demo Data Audit ✅

### Curriculum Status
| Area | Works | With Progress |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Practical Life | 101 | 7 |
| Sensorial | 45 | 3 |
| Math | 57 | 2 |
| Language | 66 | 4 |
| Cultural | 53 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **322** | **16** |

### Teacher-Student Assignments
| Teacher | Students |
|---------|----------|
| Tredoux | 22 ✅ |
| Ivan | 0 ❌ |
| Jasmine | 0 ❌ |
| John | 0 ❌ |
| Liza | 0 ❌ |
| Michael | 0 ❌ |
| Richard | 0 ❌ |

### Issues Found
1. **Only Tredoux has students** - Other teacher logins show empty classrooms
2. **Minimal progress data** - Only 16/322 works tracked
3. **Only Amy has progress** - Other children show 0/0/0

### Recommended Fixes
- [ ] Assign 3-5 students to John (demo teacher)
- [ ] Add sample progress for demo children
- [ ] Verify empty state messages are helpful

## CHUNK 2: TODO
Next: Assign students to demo teacher + add sample progress
