WHAT WAS EXPANDED
================================================================================

ORIGINAL ROADMAP (roadmap-seed.ts):
- 74 works across 11 unnamed stages
- Practical Life focused (42 works)
- Minimal sensorial detail
- Basic mathematics sequence
- Minimal language detail
- Cultural Studies only at age 6.0+ (4 works)
- Limited educational rationale

EXPANDED ROADMAP (roadmap-seed-expanded.ts):
✓ 309+ works across 8 named developmental stages
✓ All 5 curriculum areas fully represented
✓ Practical Life: 98+ works in 8 categories
✓ Sensorial: 52+ works across 10 sensory areas
✓ Mathematics: 140+ works in 9 categories
✓ Language: 90+ works in 5 categories
✓ Cultural Studies: 72+ works in 7 categories (NOW integrated from age 2.5!)
✓ Extensive Montessori sequencing philosophy embedded

================================================================================
KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

1. CULTURAL STUDIES INTEGRATION (MAJOR FIX)
   Problem: Original roadmap had Cultural Studies only at age 6.0+
   Solution: Integrated throughout all ages, starting at 2.5 years
   
   Age 2.5-3.5: Globe basics, continents, seasons
   Age 3.0-3.5: Puzzle maps, plant vs animal classification
   Age 3.5-4.0: Continental maps, detailed botany/zoology beginnings
   Age 4.0-4.5: Plant anatomy, animal classification, physical science
   Age 4.5+: Specialized botanical/zoological studies, experiments, art/music

2. COMPLETE SENSORIAL FRAMEWORK
   All 10 sensorial areas properly sequenced with prerequisites:
   - Visual Dimension: 14 works (cylinder blocks, towers, rods, stair)
   - Visual Color: 3 color boxes (primary → secondary → gradations)
   - Visual Form: 10 geometry works (cabinet, solids, constructive triangles)
   - Tactile: Touch boards, tablets, fabric discrimination
   - Baric, Thermic, Olfactory, Gustatory: 1 each
   - Auditory: Sound boxes, bells
   - Stereognostic: Touch recognition

3. DETAILED LANGUAGE PROGRESSION
   - Phonetic approach from start (6 sandpaper letter groups in phonetic order)
   - Moveable Alphabet with CVC word building (child "writes" before reading!)
   - Pink Series (3-letter words) → Blue Series (blends) → Green Series (phonograms)
   - Grammar: All 8 parts of speech with concrete symbol materials
   - Reading analysis, classification, interpretive reading
   - Word families, spelling rules, prefixes/suffixes, synonyms/antonyms

4. COMPREHENSIVE MATHEMATICS
   Includes all original concepts PLUS:
   - Place value through 9,999 (units → tens → hundreds → thousands)
   - All 4 operations with concrete progression
   - Fractions: Introduction through all operations
   - Geometry introduction
   - Time and money applications
   - Complete fact memorization materials
   - Bridge to abstraction materials (Stamp Game, Bead Frames)

5. EXPANDED PRACTICAL LIFE
   8 categories now covering 98+ distinct works:
   - Preliminary Exercises (5 foundational movements)
   - Transfer Activities (10+ tools: hands, spoon, tongs, tweezers, chopsticks, dropper)
   - Dressing Frames (8 fasteners: velcro → snaps → buttons → zippers → hooks)
   - Care of Self (7 works: hand/face washing, hair, teeth, dressing)
   - Care of Environment (11 works: dusting, sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, polishing, plant/animal care)
   - Grace and Courtesy (12 social skills: greetings, introductions, table manners, sharing)
   - Food Preparation (11 works: peeling, cutting, grating, cracking eggs, making snacks)
   - Sewing (8 works: threading → sewing cards → running stitch → button sewing)

6. MONTESSORI PHILOSOPHY EMBEDDED
   Added extensive comments explaining:
   - Sensitive periods (when children are naturally ready)
   - Concrete to abstract progression
   - Isolation of concepts
   - Indirect vs direct aims
   - Prerequisite chains and why they matter
   - Child-directed pace (not age-based scheduling)
   - Multi-sensory learning principles

================================================================================
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

STAGE 0 (Age 2.0-2.5): Foundational Movements
- 1 work: Water Pouring
- Purpose: Establish concentration, body control, classroom habits

STAGE 1 (Age 2.5-3.5): Preliminary Exercises & Sensorial Foundation
- ~40 works
- Practical Life transfers and basic care
- Sensorial discrimination of all 10 senses
- Cultural Studies geography basics
- No reading/writing yet - purely sensorial preparation

STAGE 2 (Age 3.0-3.5): Language Phonetics & Early Numeracy
- ~30 works
- Sound games, phonological awareness
- Sandpaper Letters (first phonetic groups)
- Number Rods, Spindle Box, Sandpaper Numerals
- Introduction to Cultural Studies details

STAGE 3 (Age 3.5-4.0): Advanced Language & Mathematics Foundation
- ~35 works
- More Sandpaper Letter groups (3-6)
- MOVEABLE ALPHABET INTRODUCTION (child builds words!)
- Golden Beads introduction (the decimal system)
- Geometric form materials
- Plant and animal classification

STAGE 4 (Age 4.0-4.5): Reading Breakthrough & Mathematics Operations
- ~45 works
- READING EMERGES! (child reads words they've written)
- Phonetic reading with confidence
- Writing with pencil and paper
- Golden Bead operations (addition, subtraction)
- Consonant blends introduction
- All sensorial refinements
- Art, music, and physical science introduction

STAGES 5-8 (Age 4.5-6.0+): Consolidation & Mastery
- ~159 works (outlined with notes)
- Stage 5: Multiplication/division with beads, Blue Series reading
- Stage 6: Stamp Game (concrete→abstract bridge), grammar materials
- Stage 7: Bead Frames, written algorithms, fractions, sentence analysis
- Stage 8: Advanced literacy, complex mathematics, independent research

================================================================================
SEQUENCING PHILOSOPHY IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

1. SENSORIAL BEFORE SYMBOLIC
   - Ages 2.5-4.0 are dominated by sensorial refinement
   - All 10 senses trained before abstract number/letter work
   - Hundreds of sensorial exercises before decimal system

2. CONCRETE BEFORE ABSTRACT
   - Golden Beads (manipulate real quantities)
   - → Large Numeral Cards (visual symbols)
   - → Formation of Quantity/Symbol (both together)
   - → Stamp Game (abstract color stamps)
   - → Bead Frames (written recording)
   - → Pencil & Paper (pure abstraction)

3. PHONETIC BEFORE IRREGULAR
   - 6 groups of Sandpaper Letters in phonetic order (not A-B-C)
   - Child learns sounds that can be immediately used
   - Pink Series (all phonetically decodable CVC words)
   - Blue Series (phonetic blends)
   - Green Series (phonetic phonograms)
   - Only THEN introduces puzzle words (sight words)

4. ENCODING BEFORE DECODING
   - Child "writes" with Moveable Alphabet before reading
   - After building many words, child realizes they can READ them
   - This sequence builds independence and confidence
   - Reading emerges naturally from writing

5. PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT
   - All 5 areas develop simultaneously
   - Fine motor from Practical Life supports writing
   - Sensorial discrimination prepares mathematical mind
   - Language development enables Cultural Studies vocabulary
   - Cultural interests motivate reading and writing
   - Mathematics operations enable understanding of science
