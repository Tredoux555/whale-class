When they fold a chain of 27 beads into a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube, the dramatic size difference shows how fast numbers grow when cubed.

By allowing children to count and fold actual chains representing 2\u00b3, 3\u00b3, 4\u00b3, and beyond, children develop intuitive understanding of how volume grows exponentially.
