INTENDED USERS
================================================================================

- Montessori teachers (classroom and home)
- Parents implementing Montessori at home
- Teacher trainees in Montessori programs
- Curriculum designers
- Educational app developers
- Anyone seeking AMI-quality Montessori guidance

================================================================================
APPLICATION CONTEXT
================================================================================

These guides were created for a Montessori educational app where teachers
judge quality by comparing to their knowledge of actual AMI/AMS materials
and curricula. Each guide reflects authentic Montessori pedagogy and
should enable teachers to evaluate the app's mathematical content.

================================================================================
PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
================================================================================

The Montessori mathematics curriculum follows:

1. CONCRETE TO ABSTRACT
   - Begins with manipulatives (golden beads)
   - Transitions through semi-concrete (charts, boards)
   - Ends with abstract symbols and algorithms

2. INDIVIDUAL TO UNIVERSAL
   - Starts with single quantities
   - Builds to understanding patterns and relationships
   - Leads to universal mathematical principles

3. SENSORIAL TO CONCEPTUAL
   - Uses all senses in learning
   - Develops mathematical thinking through experience
   - Creates meaningful understanding, not rote memorization

4. PRACTICAL TO MATHEMATICAL
   - Begins with real-world meaning
   - Progresses to pure mathematical concepts
   - Maintains connection between theory and application

================================================================================
SOURCES AND RESEARCH
================================================================================

Research based on:
- Montessori Album materials (official teacher guides)
- AMI Training Organization resources
- Montessori Portal and related reference sites
- Academic sources on Montessori mathematics
- Verified educational sources and practitioners

Web sources referenced in research:
- montessori-portal.com
- montessorialbum.com
- reachformontessori.com
- infomontessori.com
- montessori-academy.com
- Various other authenticated Montessori resources

================================================================================
NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

1. Presentation Order
   - Follow the progression suggested in each guide
   - Respect prerequisite understandings
   - Allow sufficient time at each level before progression

2. Pacing
   - Each child progresses at their own pace
   - Repetition is essential for internalization
   - Don't rush toward abstract symbols

3. Environment
   - Organize materials on accessible shelves
   - Provide adequate floor/table space
   - Create calm, focused atmosphere

4. Observation
   - Watch for signs of understanding
   - Note common challenges specific to your learners
   - Adjust presentation based on observations

5. Extensions
   - Suggested extensions in each guide
   - Allow child-led exploration
   - Connect math to other curriculum areas
