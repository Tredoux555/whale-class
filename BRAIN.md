# Montree Brain

> Say "read the brain" at session start. Say "update brain" at session end.

## Current State (Jan 30, 2026)

**App**: Montree - Montessori classroom management
**Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind
**Deployed**: Railway (API) + Vercel (frontend) at teacherpotato.xyz
**Status**: Working, recently fixed Suspense build issue

## Recent Changes

### Session - Jan 30, 2026 (Continued)
- **AI Analysis Fix**: Now uses FULL learning journey data (not just 4 weeks)
- AI reads notes from `montree_work_sessions` table (previously missed)
- AI "thinks like a teacher who's known the child for years"
- WorkWheelPicker simplified: single "Select" button, defaults to `not_started`
- **Curriculum Fix**: New classrooms auto-assign full curriculum during onboarding
- Created backfill endpoint: `/api/montree/admin/backfill-curriculum`

### Session - Jan 30, 2026 (Earlier)
- Replaced all whale emojis (🐋) with tree emojis (🌳) across 44 source files + 5 icon SVGs
- Skipped historical docs to preserve project history

### Previous Sessions
- Progress display bug fixed - status values are `not_started`, `presented`, `practicing`, `mastered`
- WorkWheelPicker created (`components/montree/WorkWheelPicker.tsx`) - drum picker triggered by long-press on area icons
- Student grid auto-resize fixed with CSS Grid
- Suspense fix pushed (wrapped `useSearchParams()` in curriculum-import page)

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|

| `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` | Student detail with wheel picker |

## Database

**Supabase Project**: dmfncjjtsoxrnvcdnvjq

### Key Tables
- `schools` - School records
- `classrooms` - Classrooms per school
- `montree_children` - Students
- `children` - Legacy children table (FK target)
- `montree_child_progress` - Progress tracking (status per work)
- `montree_work_sessions` - Teacher notes/observations (detailed session logs)
- `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` - Curriculum assigned to classrooms
- `montree_weekly_analysis` - Cached AI analysis results
- `curriculum_areas` - Area definitions
- `curriculum_works` - Work items

### Status Values
Progress uses: `not_started` → `presented` → `practicing` → `mastered`
(NOT `completed` - that was the old bug)

## Demo Logins
- `butter1` = Butterfly Class
- `rainbo2` = Rainbow Class

## Architecture Notes

### Curriculum Flow
1. Static curriculum in `curriculum-data.ts` (fallback)
2. Schools can customize via `school_curriculum` table
3. Classrooms inherit from school or override via `classroom_curriculum`
4. Progress tracked in `child_work_completion`

### Auth Flow
- Teachers log in with class code
- Principals register schools, create classrooms
- Parents get invite codes from teachers

## Pending / Next Up
- [ ] Push commits (git auth issue - needs manual `git push` from local machine)
- [ ] Test new school onboarding to confirm curriculum auto-assigns
- [ ] Test AI analysis with teacher notes integration
- [ ] Consider running backfill for existing classrooms missing curriculum

## Gotchas
- `useSearchParams()` must be wrapped in Suspense boundary (Next.js 16)
- Foreign key: `child_work_completion.child_id` → `children.id` (not montree_children!)
- Progress status mapping in `lib/montree/db.ts` - don't use 'completed'
- Railway rebuilds can take a few minutes
