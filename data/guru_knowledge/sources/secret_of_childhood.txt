“Tt 1s too often required of children that they should
adjust themselves to the world, practised and alert.
But it would be more to the purpose that the world
should adjust itself to children in all its dealings with
them ”

Alice Meynell, The Unready.
CHAPTER I
THE CHILD TO-DAY
THE CENTURY OF THE CHILD

Tne amazingly rapid progress in the care and educa-
tion of children im recent years may be attnbuted
partly to a generally higher standard of life, but still
more to an awakening of conscience Not only 1s
there an mcreasing concern for child health—ait began
m the last decade of the XIXth century—but also a
new awareness of the personality of the child as some-
thing of the highest importance To-day it 1s mmpos-
sible to go deeply into any branch of medicme or
philosophy or sociology without taking account of the
contnbution brought by a knowledge of child hfe A
parallel, but on a lesser scale, 1s the ght thrown by
embryology on physiology im general and on evolution
But the study of the child, not sn his physical but in his
psychological aspect, may have an imfinitely wider
fluence, extending to all human questions In the
mind of the child we may perhaps find the key to pro-
gress, and, who knows, the beginning of a new civilisa~
tion

The Swedish poet and author, Ellen Key, prophesied
that our century would be the century of the child
While anyone with patience to hunt through historical
documents would find a recurrence of such ideas in
the first King’s Speech of King Victor Emmanuel II
in Italy, when, m 1900, at the turn of the century, he

8
THE CHILD AND PSYCHO-ANALYSIS

succdeeded to the throne after the assassmation of
his predecessor He spoke of the new era beginning
with the new century, and he too spoke of it as the
Century of the Child

It would seem that such almost prophetic glimpses
arose from the impression produced by the mvestiga-
trons of science in the Jast ten years of the XIXth
century ; from the picture they gave of the child in
sickness, ten times more exposed than the adult to
death from infectious disease, or of the child as vichm
im harsh schools No one could have foreseen then
that the child held within himself a secret of life, able
to lift the veil from the mysteries of the human soul ;
that he represented an unknown quantity, the discovery
of which might enable the adult to solve his individual
and social problems This aspect may prove the
foundation of a new science of child study, capable of
influencing the whole social hfe of man

THE CHILD AND PSYCHO-ANALYSIS

Psycho-analysis has thrown open a realm of re-
search formerly unknown, bringing to light the secrets
of the unconscious, but it has brought no practical
solution to the urgent practical problems of hfe. None
the less, it may help us to understand the contnbution
to be found in the Indden life of the child.

Psycho-analysis has, one might say, broken through
the cortex of consciousness which psychology had previ~
ously considered as a ne plus ultra, ike the Columns
of Hercules im ancient history, which, for the Greek

9
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

seamen, were limits beyond which superstition set the
edge of the world

Psycho-analysis has sounded the ocean of the
unconscious Without this discovery it would be hard
to explain to the public at large how the child mind
may help in a more searching study of human prob-
lems As 1s well-known, psycho-analysis began as a
new techmique for the cure of mental diseases, and
was hence a branch of medicme It made a truly
illummating discovery in establishing the power of the
unconscious over human actions It has been, as it
were, a study of psychic reactions behind conscious-
ness, of responses which bring to hght hidden factors
and unsuspected realities, revolutiomsing accepted
ideas They reveal the existence of an unknown
world of vast extent, with which, one might say, the
destiny of the individual is bound up But psycho-
analysis cannot fully explore this unknown world In
Charcot’s time, in the last century, psychiatry dis-
covered the subconscious Just as m a volcano the
seething elements in the core of the earth force their
way to the surface, the subconscious was seen to
manufest itself in exceptional cases in the graver states
of mental disease Hence its strange phenomena, con-
flicting with the manifestations of consciousness, were
considered merely as symptoms of disease Freud
took a contrary path By a laborious techmque he
found the way to penetrate to the unconscious, but
til recently he too tended to confine himself to the
domain of pathology For how many norma: persons
would willingly submit to the painful tests of psycho-

10
THE CHILD AND PSYCHO-ANALYSIS

analysis? To a kind of operation on the soul? It
was thus from his treatment of the sick that Freud
deduced his psychological theories, and the new psy-
chology was in large measure built up on personal
deductions drawn from abnormality Hence Freud’s
theories have proved inadequate, nor has his technique
of treatnmg the sick been wholly satisfactory, for it
has not always led to a healing of “sickness of the
soul” As a result, social traditions, which are the
deposit of ancient experience, have risen as a barrier
against certam generalisations of Freudian theory.
Perhaps the exploration of the vast reality of the un-
conscious requires somethmg quite other than a
technique of chnical treatment or theoretical deduc-
tions

THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

The task of sounding this ocean of the unconscious
remains for other branches of science and demands
another approach—the study of man from his ongins,
im an endeavour to decipher in the child soul its deve-
lopment through conflict with its environment, to learn
the dramatic or tragic secret of the struggles through
which the soul of man has remained disfigured and
darkened

Psycho-analysis touched this secret One of the
most impressive discoveries due to its technique was
how a psychosis may ongmate in the distant age of
mfancy The memories evoked from the subconscious
proved that in sfancy there were sufferings other than
those commonly known, and which Jay so latent in

ll
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

consciousness, so far from accepted ideas, that their .
discovery was the most impressive and perturbing of
all the discoveries of psycho-analysis Such sufferings
were of a purely psychic order, slow and constant ,
they had never been recogmised as facts hable to lead
to psychic sickness of the adult personality They
sprang from the repression of the spontaneous activity
of the child by the adult who had authority over him,
and were therefore to be associated with the adult
whose influence was greatest—the mother

We must draw a clear distinction between the two
planes of enquiry covered by psycho-analysis One,
the more superficial, covers the clash between the in-
stincts of the individual and the environment to which
he must adapt himself This conflict may be resolved,
for it 1s not difficult to bring to consciousness the dis-
turbing causes that he below consciousness But
there 1s also another, deeper plane, that of infant
memories in which the conflict 1s not between man
and his present social environment, but between the
child and the mother, or, we may say generally,
between the child and the adult This con-
flict may lead to diseases far harder to cure In all
diseases, physical as well as mental, the importance of
events that have occurred in infancy 1s now recognised
But here some other method than psycho-analysis 1s
needed The very technique of sounding the uncon-
scious that allows discoveries to be made an the cases
of adults, becomes an obstacle in the case of the child
The child, who by nature 15 not a fit subject for such
technique, has not to remember his infancy He

12
THE CHILD AND PSYCHO-ANALYSIS

must be observed rather than analysed, but observed
from the psychic standpoint in an endeavour to ascer-
tain the conflict through which he passes in tus rela-
tions with grown-up persons and with his social envi-
ronment. It 1s clear that this approach will lead us
away from psycho-analytic theories and technique,
into a new field of observation of the child m his
social existence It is not a case of the tortuous laby-
mnths of a sick mind, but of the wide expanse of human
life in its realty, centring round the psychological life
of the child For the practical problem embraces
the whole hfe of man as it develops from birth
onwards

The page of human history that tells the adventures
of man as mind has yet to be read—of the child as
through his senses he encounters obstacles and finds
himself involved in insuperable conflicts with the
grown-up who 1s stronger than he, who masters him
without understanding him Here was a blank page
that had yet to receive the story of the unrealised
sufferings that convulse the intact and delicate spiritual
existence of the child, organismg in his subconscious
a lower man, different from what nature had intended

This complex question psycho-analysis illuminates
but does not solve Psycho-analysis deals mainly with
disease and remedial treatment The problem of the
child psyche contains a prophylactic where psycho-
analysis 1s concerned, for it will affect the normal and
general treatment of mfant humanity, a treatment that
helps to avert obstacles and conflicts and hence their
consequences—the psychological diseases dealt with by

13
TBE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

psycho-analysis, or else those moral maladjustments
which extend to nearly the whole of humanity

Round the child therefore a new field of scientific
exploration has come into being, distinct from psycho-
analysis, its sole parallel It smplhes essentially a
form of assistance to the psychic life of infancy, and 1s
concerned with normality and with education _Its
charactertenstic 1s therefore the ascertamment of psy-
chological facts as yet unknown to the child, and at
the same time an awakening of the adult, who, m
tegard to the child, adopts mistaken attitudes that have
their root in the subconscious

ACCUSATION

The word repression as used by Freud to indicate
the deep-seated ongins of psychological disturbances
in the adult explains itself

The child cannot expand m the manner required
by a bemg in process of development, for the adult
represses him “The adult” 1s an abstraction The
child 1s isolated im society, so if the adult mfluences
him, that adult is a given adult, the adult closest to
him—his mother first, then his father, then his
teachers

Society attributes to adults quite another role, giving
them the credit of the education and development, of
the child Now, on the contrary, the sounding of the
depths of the soul brings to hight an accusation agamst
those who have been recognised as the guardians and
benefactors of humanity But smce almost all are
fathers or mothers and many are teachers or entrusted

4
ACCUSATION

with the care of children, the accusation covers the
adult world m general, the society responsible for the
children, This startling accusation has something
apocalyptic about it, it 1s mysterious and termble lke
the voice of the Last Judgment “What have you
done with the children that I entrusted to you?”

The first reaction is one of self-defence, of protest .
“we did our best We love our children We sacn-
ficed ourselves for them” And this juxtaposes two
conflicting attitudes, the one conscious, the other nsing
from what 1s unconscious The defence is famular,
it 1s old and deep-rooted and holds no mterest for us.
What 1s of interest 1s the accusation, or rather, those
whom it envisages They struggle and strive to per-
fect the care and education of their children, and they
find themselves caught in a network of problems, for
they do not know the error they harbour in themselves

All who preach in favour of the child must mamtain
this, accusation against the adult, an accusation with-
out remission, without exception And all at once,
this accusation becomes a centre of fascinating interest
For it denounces not merely mvoluntary errors, but
errors of which we are wholly siconscious, and there-
fore it increases our stature, leading us to the discovery
of ourselves And every true advance comes from the
discovery, the utilisation of the unknown

For this reason in every age the attitude of men
towards their own errors has been contradictory
Everyone 1s offended by conscious error, and is attract-
ed and fascmated by unknown error Unknown error
holds the secret of progress beyond the goal that 1s

15
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

known and desured, and raises us to a higher realm
Thus the mediseval kmght who was ready to fight a
duel at the smallest accusation that impinged on his
conscious code, would prostrate himself before the
altar, saying humbly, “I am guilty, 1 declare at before
all, and the fault is mime alone * The Bible gives
interesting examples of such contsadictons What
was it that brought the crowd round Jonah at Nineveh,
so that King and people were filled with enthusiasm,
and thronged the streets in the wake of the prophet?
He proclasmed them such appalling sinners that rf they
were not converted Nineveh would be destroyed How
did John the Baptist summon the crowds to the bank
of the Jordan, what alluring terms did he employ to
obtain such an extraordinary concourse of people?
He called them a “brood of vipers”

Here 1s a spiritual phenomenon—men who flock to
hear themselves accused. And by so domg they
assent, they admit their fault. There are harsh and
insistent charges that summon the unconscious to con-
sciousness , all spimtual development 1s an achieve-
ment of consciousness, which assumes ito itself what
was once outside it. It 1s thus, mdeed, that civilisa-
tion advances, by successive discoveries

Now if the child 1s to recerve a different treatment
from what it receives to-day, in order to save it from
conflicts endangermg its psychic life, there 1s a first
fundamental, essential step to be taken, from which
all will depend—the modification of the adult In-
deed .f the adult 1s already doing all he can, and, as
he will say, loves the child to the point of sacnifice, he

16
 

acknowledges that he 1s faced by an insuperable prob-
Jem He must necessarily seek beyond what 1s known,
voluntary and conscious

Even in the child there 1s much that 1s unknown
There is a part of the soul of the child that has always
been unknown. and that must be known In the child,
too, there 1s need for the discovery that will lead us
to the unknown For besides the child observed and
studied by psychology and education, there remains
the unknown child We must seek for him in a spirt
of enthusiasm, like those who know of hidden gold,
and who explore unknown lands and move mountains
in search of the precious metal This 1s what the
adult must do in searching for this unknown something
hidden in the soul of the child Thus 1s the Jabour in
which all must partake, without distinction of caste,
race or nation, for it will mean the bringing forth of
an indispensable factor for the moral progress of
humanity.

The adult has not understood the child or the ado-
lescent and is therefore in contmual stnfe with him
The remedy 1s not that the adult should learn some-
thing intellectually, or complete a deficient culture
He must find a different startmg-point The adult
must find in himself the hitherto unknown error that

Conscious. means suffering and anguish, and a single

tant at the remedy brings perception of acute need
‘Thus a man who has a finger out of jomt feels the need
to have it put in place, for he realises that his hand
cannot work or his pain cease tl this is done In the
same way, as soon as he understands his error, man
feels the need to set iis conscience m order, for from
that moment the weakness and pain that he has long
borne become intolerable And once this has been
done, all becomes easy No sooner do we come to
the conviction that we had taken too much credit to
ourselves, that we had believed ourselves able to do
what lay beyond our sphere and our possibilities, than
it becomes possible and iteresting to recognise the
characteristics of souls as diverse from our own as
those of children

The adult has become egocentric im relation to the
child, not egotistic, but egocentric Thus he consi-
ders everything that affects the psyche of the child
from the standpoint of its reference to himself, and so
musunderstands the child It 1s this pomt of view
that Jeads to a consideration of the child as an empty
being, which the adult must fill by his own endeavours,
as an mert and mcapable being for whom everything
taust be done, as a bemg without an inner guide,
whom the adult must guide step by step from without
Finally, the adult acts as though he were the child’s
creator, and considers good and evil in the child’s
actions from the standpoint of relation to himself
The adult 1s the touchstone of good and evil He is
infallible , he 1s the good on which the child must
model himself Any way in which the child departs

from the characteristics of the adult 1s an evil that
must be speedily corrected And in adopting such
an attitude, which unconsciously cancels the child’s
“personality, the adult feels a conviction of zeal, love
and sacrifice

THE SPIRITUAL EMBRYO

BIOLOGICAL PRELUDL

‘

Wuen Wolf announced his discoveries on the seg-
mentation of the germ-cell, he threw new light on the
process of the creation of living creatures, and at the
same time made it possible to verify, by direct obser-
vation, the existence of ner forces working in accord-
ance with a pre-determmed pattern It was he who
overthrew certain philosophical ideas, like those of
Leibmitz and Spallanzi, by which the germ was sup-
posed to contain m mimature the complete form of
the future creature They supposed that in the ovum,
that 1s to say from the beginning, the beg that would
develop if brought mto a favourable environment was
already formed, albeit imperfectly and in infinitesimal
Proportions This idea came from the observation of
the seed of a plant, which contams, hidden between the
two cotyledons, a tiny plant in which we can recognise
toot and leaves and which, set in the earth, develops
ito the new plant. It was supposed that an analog-
sous process held good for animals and for man

But when Wolf, after the disccvery of the mucro-

190
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

scope, was able to observe how a hiving being 1s teally
formed (he began by observing the embryos of birds),
he found that the first stage 1s a simple germ-cell, m
which the microscope, by its very power to render
visible what 1s mvisible to the naked eye, shows that
there 1s no pre-existent form at all The germ-cell,
which results from the umon of two cells, male and
female, consists simply of membrane, protoplasm and
nucleus hke every other cell, mdeed st 1s merely a
simple cell, im its most primary form, without any
visible differentiation Every living creature, whether
plant or anmmal, comes from a primary, simple and un-
differentiated cell The tmy plant within the seed is
an embryo that has already developed from the germ-
cell , it completed its earlier stages in the fruit, from
which the mpened seed fell to earth

The germ-cell, however, possesses a most singular
property, that of rapid subdivision, and of subdivision
on a pre-established pattern But of this pattern
there 1s not the smallest trace im the ongmal cell If
we follow the earliest developments of the animal
embryo, we see the first cell spht mto two, these two
into four, and so on, til they form a kind of hollow
ball, known as the morula, which next introflects into
two layers, leaving an aperture, and forming a kind of
hollow, double-walled cavity, the gastrula And thus
by continued multiplication, introfiexion and differen-
tation, it develops into a complicated whole of organs
and tissues The germ-cell, therefore, simple, trans-
parent and devoid of any matenal design, works and
builds in exact obedience to the immaterial order it

20
BIOLOGICAL PRELUDE

bears within itself—lke a faithful servant who knows
by heart the mission he has received and who fulfils
it, though carrying on his person no document that
could reveal the secret order he has been given. The
design 1s discernible only through the activity of the
indefatigable cells, and we can see only the completed
work. Beyond the completed work nothing exists

In the embryos of mammals, and hence of men the
first organ to appear 1s the heart, or rather, that which
will become the heart—a vesicle that begins at once
to beat in a regular rhythm, beating twice for each
beat of the heart of the mother And it will continue
to beat unwearying, for it 1s the vital motor that enables
all the vital tissues to form, pulsing to them the nou-
rishment they need for life

All this labour 1s hidden, and 1s wonderful precisely
because it 1s done thus alone. It is the miracle of
creation from nothing Those wise little living cells
never make mistakes, and find in themselves the power
for far-reaching transformations, some becoming carti-
lage cells, some nerve cells, some skin cells, and each
ussue finds its exact place. This marvel of creation
is one of the secrets of the universe, nigorously kept ;
nature envelops it in impenetrable veils and sheaths,
and she alone can part them, when finally, matured
and complete, a new creature is born into the world

But the creature that 1s bom 1s not merely a
material body. Jt in its turn is like a germ-cell,
Possessing latent psychic functions, of pre-determined
type The new body does not function through its
ergans only; it has other functions—the instincts

21 ’
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

which cannot be seated in a cell but in a living body,
m a creature already born Just as every germ-cell
bears within itself the pattern of the organism-to-be,
though without visible sign, so every new-born body,
whatever its species, bears im itself a pattern of
psychical instinct, of functions that will set it in rela-
tion to its environment, for the fulfilment of a cosmic
mission And this whatever the creature, even in an
insect The marvellous imstincts of bees, which lead
them to so complex a social organisation, begin to
work only im the bee, not im the egg or in the grub
‘The instinct of flight 1s mn the bird after it 1s born, and
not before And so on This second phase which
concerns psychic life in relation to a free environment
4s inherent in the first, in the embryonic life that nature
wolates and hides Indeed when the new creature 1s
formed it 1s hke a spiritual egg, bearing withm it a
mysterious guidance, which will result m acts, charac-
ters, labours, im short, in functions acting upon its
outer environment,

This outer environment must provide not only the
means of phystological existence, but stimuh to the
Mysterious mission enscnbed in every creature that
1s born, all of which are summoned by their environ-
ment not only to hfe but to the exercise of a necessary
office for the conservation of the world and its har-
mony Each according to its species The body has
precisely the shape adapted to this psychic supet-
function, which must take its place in the economy
of the universe That such higher functions are mher-
ent i creatures as soon as they are born we see from

22
BIOLOGICAL PRELUDE

the ammals We know that one mammal will be
peaceable because it 1s a lamb, that another will be
fierce because 1t is a lon, that one msect will labour
without ceasing in unchanging discipline because it 1s
an ant, and that another will do nothing but chirp in
solitude because it 1s a cicala

And thus the new-born child 1s not only a body
ready to function as a body, but a spiritual embryo
with latent psychic capacities. It would be absurd
to think that man alone, characterised and distinct
from all other creatures by the grandeur of his mental
life, should be the only one with no pattern of psychic
development.

The spirit may be so profoundly latent that it will
not be apparent hike the instmct of the anmal, which
is at once ready to reveal itself im given actions The
absence of fixed and determined guiding instincts such
as are possessed by the animals, 1s the sign of a fund
of freedom of action, demanding a special elaboration,
almost as though it had to be created and developed
by cach individual, and were therefore unpredictable
There 1s thus a secret in the soul of the child, impossi-
ble to penetrate unless he himself reveals it as little
by little he builds up us bemg It 1s the same as in the
Scgmentation of the germ-cell, where there is nothing
but an invisible pre-determined pattem, which there is
nO means of discernmg and which will manifest ttself
only with the gradual creation of the details of the
organism And therefore only the child can bnng us
Tevclation of the natural pattern of man But because
of the delicacy of all creation from nothing, the psychic

life of the child needs a defence and an environment
analogous to the sheaths and veils that nature has set
round the physical embryo

“A quivering voice was heard on the earth,

“A quivering voice was heard on the earth,

Tt came from a throat that had never stured before

“They told me of a man who had lived in the deepest dark-

he were in the depths of an abyss

“They told me of a man who had lived im silence, not
even the faintest sound had ever reached his ears

“T heard tell of a man who had really lived, always under
water, a water of strange warmth, and who all at once was
plunged into an icy stream

“And he unfolded Jungs that had never breathed. The air
all at once distended his lungs, which bad been folded from

THE NEW-BORN BABE

The new-born child does not come into a natural
environment, but into the civilised environment of the
hfe of men It is a “supernatural” environment, built
up above and at the expense of nature, through the
urge to procure all that will assist the life of man in
all tts details and make it easier for him to adjust him-
self But what providence has prepared a civilisation
to assist the new-born babe, man who must achieve
the greatest of all efforts at adjustment, when he
passes by birth from one hfe to another ?

The tremendous transition of buth demands a
Scientific treatment of the new-born babe, for m no
other period of man’s hfe will he find a lke occasion
of struggle and confit, and hence of suffermg

But no provision is made to ease this tremendous
passage In the history of human civilisation a page
should be set before all others, telling what civilised
man does to help the newly born But here, indeed,
the paper is blank

Many will say that, on the contrary, civilisation
takes a great deal of thought for the new-born child

How does it do so?

When a child is born, all concern goes to the
mother The mother has suffered so greatly

But has not the child suffered too?

The mother needs special care

But does not the child, too, need special care ?

The mother’s room is darkened and silent, for she

But it 1s the child who has just come from a place
where not the faintest ray of light, or the famtest

sound, could reach hum It is for him, then,
darkness and silence should be prepared

The child has come from absolute rest, and
now, all at once, to exercise all his functions

He, therefore, must be tired and exhausted

His exhaustion does not come only from the «
trast between two opposite environments , he has
endured the exhausting labour of birth by his
efforts His body was compressed, as though .
mull, that squeezed it to the pomt of displacing
bones He arnves worn out by the ummense con

He 1s lke a pilgrim who comes from somew

‘The parents, on the contrary, gaze on it with
demess and joy, and they welcome it with the ego
of those who rejoice m a gift from nature “The
baby? Our son?”

man, the first umage of Christ, pure and mcompre-
hended

How does the adult approach the bemg who comes
from nothing, and who now finds himself in the world
with those delicate eyes that have never seen hght,
those ears that had been engulfed in silence? This
creature with tortured limbs that had till then touched
nothing ?

The debate body is exposed to brutal contact with
solid objects, 1t 1s handled by the soulless hands of a
grown-up man, who forgets its delicacy

Yes, the new-born babe 1s roughly handled, its
delicate skin 1s rubbed by heavy hands, by rough
cloths

Indeed, the family hardly dare touch it, so fragile
is it, its relations and its mother look on it with fear,
and so they entrust it to evpert hands, and set their
munds at rest ; conscience has found a refuge where it
can be at ease, No one will feel the need to watch
over and defend that little body that had known no
touch before.

People will ask,‘What then should we do? Some-
One must touch the baby ”

Yes, but those expert hands that now touch it have
never learned how to touch such a delicate creature.
They are rough hands, with the sole abilty to hold
the baby securely, without letting it fall People think
that af the baby, having passed through buth, 1s alive,
that is enough , all they seek 1s that the effort of exis-
tence should not be lost. But they have never studied
how to approach thus delicate beng
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

The doctor picks it up roughly, and as the new-
born baby gives its despairing cry, all smile im satis-
faction that is ts voice Weeping 1s its language,
and such things are necessary for 1t, to wash its eyes
and distend sts lungs

The new-born child 1s immediately clothed

Once it was wrapped m rigid swaddlng clothes, as
if it were set in plaster, and its limbs, which from the
beginning had been folded together, were stretched
out and fixed with cruel force

Yet it 1s not necessary to clothe the baby, neither
mediately after bith nor during the first month of
life

Jf we want to follow the story of the clothing of
new-born babies, we find a gradual evolution, from
rigid supports to soft, ight clothmg, with a gradual
decrease in the size of its wardrobe To-day, indeed,
the clothmng of the newly born 1s on the threshold of
nudism One step more, and it will be left naked

Indeed, 1t would be best if the baby could be left
naked, to be kept warm by the surrounding air and not
by clothes It has not sufficient heat m itself to face the
temperature outside, since it has lived till now im the
warmth of the maternal body Clothes can only pre-
serve the heat of the body, preventing it from evapo-
rating If the room 1s warmed, clothes become an
obstacle between the warmth of the ai and the child’s
body We notice among the animals that even when
the little ones are covered with fur or fluff, the
mother covers them with her body to keep them warm

We do not want to dwell too long on this argu-

ment Assuredly, if they were able to speak to me,
Americans would tell me of the care that 1s taken of
new-born children m thew country, and Germans and
English would ask me im surprise, if I am unaware
of the progress made in their countries in this branch
of medicine and nursmg And stil, I should have
to answer that I know all this, and that I have gone
im person to study all the latest refinements in child-
care im certam of these countries And all the same,
T have to declare that everywhere there is a lack of
that nobility of conscience demanded for a worthy
welcome to the man that is born

Tt is true that much 1s done, but what 1s progress
if it 1s not an awareness of that of which we were
Once unaware, an adding to what seemed complete,
and even unsurpassable ?

Nowhere in the world is the baby understood as
it should be.

I should luke to touch on another pomt—the fact
that however deeply we love the new baby, we have
an instinct of defence against him, from the first
instant of his arrival, It is not only an instinct of
defence, but an imstinct of avarice, that makes us
hasten to protect our possessions from him, however
worthless they may be im themselves, For example,
to save his wretched little mattress from being soiled,
We set a waterproof covering between it and his body,
and allow his body to suffer the consequences

From that moment, the adult mind will move to
the same rhythm: take care that the baby shall not

29
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

soll me, not be a nuisance Defence Defence
against him !

* * * * * *

I believe that as little by little humanity acquires
a fuller understanding of the child, it will find greatly
umproved methods of care Only very recently has
a begmnimg been made, m Vienna, of ways of lessen-
ing the sufferings of the new-born baby The bit of
mattress on which it must fall in birth 1s warmed, and
mattresses have been imvented of absorbent matenal,
that can be thrown away as soon as they are soiled.
These expedients are a prelude, a first sign of a fact
of ummense umportance—that the consciousness of the
adult 1s beginning to be aware of the baby

But the care of the new-born baby should not be
Iumited to preserving it from death, to 1solatmg it
from infection, as is done to-day in the more modern
chnics where the nurses who approach it cover their
faces with bandages so that the microbes from their
breath shall not reach it There are the problems of
the “psychic care of the child”, from the very moment
of birth—and those of measures to facilitate his ad-
Justment to the world To this end experuments have
still to be made in clinics, and propaganda ts required
an families 1 order that the attitude towards the newly
born should be changed

In nich famihes people still think of grand cradles
and fine lace for the baby’s clothing Such luxury
shows a complete absence of consideration for the
child's inner being Wealth should be employed in

30
THE NEW-BORN BABE

provision of comfort not of luxury, for such privileged
children

For the baby it would be a comfort to have a room
Sheltered from the noise of the town, with sufficient
silence, and a light that can be moderated and correct-
ed as, for example, 1s done in churches by stained
glass windows A warm, constant temperature, such
as has for some years been obtamable m operating
theatres, should allow the child to he naked

Another problem is that of moving and carrying the
naked child, so that it should be touched as httle as
possible by the hands The child should be picked
up by means of a light, yielding support, like a softly
stuffed hammock, supporting the whole body gathered
together in a position resembling that of pre-natal
Conditions Such supporters should be handled with
great delicacy and deliberation, by clean hands render-
ed skilful by careful practice To change the position
of the child from vertical to horizontal calls for special
skill Nurses have for long realised that a special
techmique 1s required for hiftmg a sick person and
carrying him honzontally and slowly The transport
of the sick 1s one of the elementary lessons of nursing
No one pulls a sick person up vertically by the arm;
he is moved by means of a yielding support, delicately
introduced under his body, and by this method he can
be moved without changing his horizontal position

Now the new-born baby is a sick person. Like its
mother, it has passed through penl of death, The
Joy and satisfaction of seeing it alive 1s also relief at
the danger it has escaped. Sometimes the baby is

31
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

almost suffocated, and has to be brought to life by the
rapid administration of artificial respiration Its head
as often deformed by a haematoma, that 1s, by a flow
of blood beneath the skin It must thus be considered
really as sick But at the same time the new-born baby
must not be confused with a sick adult. Its needs are
not those of a sick person, but of one who makes an im-
conceivable effort of readjustment, accompanied by the
first mental impressions of a beimg that has come from
nothing, but whose senses are active I have seen a
new-born baby that had been barely saved from a
dangerous condition of suffocation, plunged into a
basin almost on the level of the ground, and, as it was
rapidly lowered into the water, it opened its eyes wide
and gave a convulsive leap, stretching out its arms and
legs, as though it felt itself falling That was its first
experience of fear

The feeling we should have towards the new-born
baby 1s not the compassion that we have for the sick
or weak, but reverence before the mystery of creation,
the secret of an infinite taking bounded form

The manner of handling the new-born babe and
the dehcacy of feelng that should inspire such hand-
ling, make one think of the Catholic priest as he
handles the Host at the altar With purified hands,
which have practised every detail of ther movement,
with what delicacy and deliberation does he move the
Host now vertically, now hohzontally, setting It down
from time to tume, as if It were weary, as if even such
Movements were so vigorous as to need interruption
And while he raises up the Host, he prostrates himself

32
NATURE'S TEACHING

in worship Here 1s silence ; the light that enters 1s
subdued by coloured glass , a feeling of hope, of eleva-
tion fills the whole environment , such 1s the environ-
ment worthy of the child

* * * * * * *

The baby, people say, 1s not conscious, and without
consciousness there can be neither pain nor pleasure,
such refinements would therefore be wasted on it But
how much care 1s lavished on sick adults whose life
1s in danger and who are unconscious? It 1s the need
of care and not the consciousness of that need that,
im respect of every other age of human hfe, calls for
the attention of science and feeling

No justification 1s possible

We have no real feeling for the new-born baby ;
for us itis not human When it comes into our world,
we do not know how to receive st, although the world
that we have created 1s destined for it, so that 1t may
continue it, and make of it a better world than ours

“He came into the world, and the world was made
by him but the world knew him not He came unto
his own and his own received him not.”

NATURE'S TEACHING

The higher animals, the mammals, in the unchang-
ing wisdom of instinct, have not overlooked the deh-
cate and difficult period of adjustment that faces their
new-born young The humble cat is an example ; she
fides her kittens as soon as they are born, finding some
dark, remote place in which to keep them, and she 1s

33
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

so jealous that she does not allow people even to look
at them And then, after a short period, they come
out and follow her openly

Mammals in a free state give still more striking
proofs of their care for the new-born The greater
number hive together i numerous herds, but the
female near delivery leaves the herd and finds a hidden
place where she gives birth to her young, keeping them
1 silence and isolation for a period of time that varies
according to the species from two or three weeks to a
month or more The mother becomes mmediately a
nurse, helpmg the new creature The little one could
not exist among the herd, exposed to light and noxse,
and therefore she keeps it m a quet, sheltered place
Although the young one can generally stand on its legs
and walk, the mother keeps it apart tll it has attained
mastery over its vital functions and has adapted itself
to the new environment After that she leads it back
to the herd, to the society of its kind .

The tale of such maternal care 1s really remarkable ;
it 18 substantially unsform, even among species as diff-
erent as horses, bisons, boars, foxes and tigers

The cow-bison stays away from the herd many
weeks, alone with her calf, tending it with gteat affec-
tion When it 1s cold she holds it between her front
hooves, when it 1s dirty she licks it clean > When it is
sucking she stands on three legs so that it May get at
the milk more easily Later she leads it back to her
own herd, and continues to suckle it with the patient
indifference we find among female quadrupeds

Sometimes the mother does not only seek isolation

34
NATURE'S TEACHING

for her delivery, but works to prepare an appropriate
place for the expected young ‘The vixen, for im-
stance, seeks in a thick covert for a remote, quiet
place, such as a cave, that may serve for dweling If
she finds no suitable place, she digs a hole, or she
prepares a bed in a hollow tree, or hollows out a thick
bush , then she makes a nest, hned with soft material,
and almost always with her own fur, which she tears
out round her dugs, thus making it easier for the cubs
to suck, And there her six or seven cubs are born,
with closed eyes and ears ; she keeps them hidden and
hardly ever leaves them

All mother beasts durmg this period guard ther
young jealously, and attack anyone who approaches
them Such instmets are overlaid or lost when the
ammals hve m a domestic state It 1s a well-known
fact that sows often eat their young, whereas the female
of the wild boar is one of the tenderest mothers
Tigresses and honesses also, in a state of captivity, mm
cages or mm zoological gardens, sometimes kill their
children We thus see that nature’s protective and
providential energies only function when creatures are
free to follow the mner commands of their guiding
imstincts

In such instincts we may trace a clear and simple
logic: the new-born young of mammals must be
cared for in a special manner during their first encoun~
ter with the outer world, and there is therefore need
to distguish a first, extremely delicate period, that
of the creature’s first advent mto the world, when it
must rest after the immense effort of birth and assume

35
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the simultaneous mastery of all its functions After
this period begins what we may call first infancy, the
first year of life, the sucking period, that 1s to say,
the first period of life m the world

The animals by isolating ther new-born young do
not care only for their bodies Nature mdeed, by
talk and the warmth of the maternal body, has already
provided agamst the mam physical difficulties to be
overcome in the new environment. The mother
rather waits im this solitude for the psychical awaken-
ing of instmcts that sprmg from the mmost being of
the new creature, and which will make it another m-
dividual of its race This awakenmg must come about
in a place sheltered from bright light or loud noises,
and im an unbroken quiet. It is for this that the
mother waits, as she feeds, cleans and lovingly helps
her offsprig, and to this end she trains 1t before lead-
ing 1t back to the herd The colt by that time will be
lively on its legs, it will have learned to know its
mother and to follow her, but above all it will have
had time for the horse nature to reveal itself 1n sts frail
and hesitant body It must bring its heredity to reah-
sation The mare will not allow her offspring to be
seen by any till it has become truly a httle horse , the
cat will hide her kittens till thew eyes have opened,
and they have learned to stand on ther feet, til,
short, they are truly little cats

It 1s plain that nature exercises a powerful supervi-
ston over this awakening, this fulfilment. The aun of
the mother’s care is higher than purely physiological
‘Through her affection and her tender care, she awaits

36
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INCARNATION

the birth of the latent mstmcts And for man we
might say by analogy that, through delicate care of
the new-born babe, we should await the spiritual
advent of the man

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INCARNATION

Is there then a psychic life to be considered in the
treatment of the new-born child? If it exists already
in the new-born child, 1t must be considered still more
during the first year of fe and later The forward
step that has been made m the care of the child to-day
1s this . that account 1s taken not only of his physical
hfe, but of his psychic life It 1s now often repeated
that education should begin from birth

Of course, the word education must not be under-
Stood in the sense of teaching, but of assistmg the
psychological development of the child To-day that
a distinction 1s drawn between consciousness and the
unconscious it 1s possible to understand how the baby
may have a real psychic hfe from the moment it is
born The idea of an unconscious full of psychic
unpulses and realities has become one of the popular
arguments of our age If we envisage the baby with
a psychic life, with the need to develop its conscious-
hess by putting itself mto active relation to the world
about it, the umage that appears to us 1s mmpressive
We see a soul, impnsoned im darkness, stnving to
come to the light, to come to birth, to grow at the
expense of an environment that has not been prepared
for such a grandiose event. We find ourselves in the
Presence of a soul engaged in this difficult task, and

37
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

we do not know how to help it, we may even hinder
at.

But even if we confine ourselves to the most ele-
mentary and self-evident ideas, we may divine mm the
baby a play of instincts governing not only sts physical
but also its psychic functions, as we see in the new-
born young of mammals when all at once, by an in-
ward event, they express the characteristics of their
race The human child indeed 1s slower to develop
its powers of movement than the young of the beasts
While the sense organs are active from birth, and the
baby 18 at once sensible to light, sound, contacts, it
has little power of movement It cannot raise itself,
ut cannot walk or speak. It hes helpless longer than
any other creature, it begins to walk after a year, with
great effort, and only after what may be prolonged
period of abortive attempts It will have Jearned to
walk properly only when it is two | With speech it 1s,
the same as with movement For a Jong time the
child 1s incapable of articulation , at six months st 1s
just beginning to utter syllables It 1s an snert crea-
ture, able to scream but not to speak, whereas new-
born ammals have already thew characteristic utter-
ance Their voice 1s ndeed famt and plamtive, but
Puppies emit a real bark, kittens miaow, and Jambs
bleat, in a word, they all have their language, not
merely screams and tears hke the children of men, the
only dumb creatures among all,

It would be a great nustake to think that it is mus-
cular weakness that prevents a baby from standing
Or sifting upright, or that an incapacity for co-ordinat-

38
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INCARNATION

ed movement is mnate m the human bemg The
muscular strength of new-born babies as proved by
the thrusts or resistance of their members cannot be
questioned And nothing could be more perfect than
the difficult co-ordination of sucking and swallowing
which they achieve from the first Nature conditions
the child otherwise than the young of ammals She
leaves the realm of movement free from the imperious
despotism of imstinct Instmct withdraws, the mus-
cles wait, strong and obedient, for a new order, they
await the command of the wil to co-ordinate them in
the service of the human spmit They must express
the characteristics not of a mere species, but of an m-
dividual soul The mstincts of the species are also
indubitably present, and will impose certain funda-
mental characteristics. we know that all normal
children will walk upnght and speak But each child
may reveal such unsuspected individual variations as
to constitute an engima. With every young anmal
we know what it will be like when it 1s fully grown ;
it will be swift-footed if it 1s a fawn, it will move slowly
and heavily if it is an elephant, it will be fierce, with
strong jaws, if it 1s a tiger, it will be gentle and feed
on fresh plants if it is a rabbit. There will be no
Change or inversion in such characteristics But man
18 capable of anything His apparent iertia prepares
the surprises of individuality His inarticulate voice
will one day speak, but we do not know in what lan-
guage He will speak the tongue that he has picked
up by listening to those about him, and with great
effort he will form the sounds, the syllables, and finally

‘.

20
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the words He will be the voluntary constructor of
all his functions in relation to his environment , he will
be the creator of his new being

This animation of bis organs of movement 1s thus
the functional incarnation of an mdividual with charac-
teristics of his own

That which 1s commonly known as the flesh 1s the
complexus of the organs of motion, known to physio-
logy as the voluntary muscles As thew name mmphes,
they can be moved by the will Nothing could better
indicate that movement 1s bound up with psychic life
But without its organs, its mstruments, the will could
do nothing

Even the mstincts of the ammals, whatever ther
species, even those of the smallest msects, could not
find expression without organs of movement In a
lughly evolved form hke that of man, the muscles are
infinitely complex, and so numerous that students of
anatomy say, “to remember all the muscles, you must
have forgotten them seven times” In their functions,
they combine for the execution of most complicated
actions Some provide impulses, others mbibitions,
some are able only to move forward, others only to
move back And yet, with all their opposing func-
tons, they do not act in contradiction but m harmony
Every impulse is corrected by an inhibition, which
therefore always accompames it, to each that moves
forward 1s umted one that moves back They are real
societies, groups united in single movements, and thus
movement is capable of infinite tefinements, as for
example, in a dancer, in the hand of a violist, who

40
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INCARNATION

can transmut infinitesimal movements to the bow of
hus mstrument. Every movement 1s an association of
opposites, every refinement calls for what 1s almost
an army of muscles, actmg simultaneously with an
opposing army, and in either case perfection 1s achiev-
ed through a tume of preparation

If this preparation is not wholly left to nature, but
if a part, indeed, the highest part, umplying direction
and construction, 1s entrusted to an individual energy,
that energy superimposed on nature 1s supernatural ,
here 1s the first fact that we must consider in man
There 1s, in fine, an animating human spit that must
become mcarnate im order to act, to express itself in
the world, Thus is the first chapter of the life of the
child, man’s first task

If there 1s an imdividual incarnation directing the
psychic development of the child, the child must poss-
ess a psychic life antecedent to its life of motion,
existing before and apart from any outward expres-
sion Hiesitant and delicate, it appears at the threshold
of consciousness, setting the senses im relation to their
environment, and immediately acting through the
muscles in the effort to find expression There is an
interplay between the individual, or rather between the
spintual embryo, and its environment, and by this
interplay the individual forms lumself, completes hum-
self This primordial, formative activity may be com-
pared to the function of the pulsing vesicle that repre-
sents the heart in the physical embryo, and which
impels nutriment to all parts of the embryomc body,
while it itself receives the infiltrations from the blood-

41
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

vessels of the mother, its vital environment Thus
the psychic individuality develops and organises itself
round the action of this motive-principle in relation
with the outside environment The child strives to
assimilate his environment and from such efforts
springs the deep-seated unity of his personality This
prolonged and gradual labour 1s a contimual process
through which the spint enters into possession of its
instrument. It must continually mamtam its sover-
eigaty by its own strength, lest movement gives place
to imertia or becomes umform and mechanical It
must continually command, so that movement, remov-
ed henceforth from the guidance of a fixed instinct,
shall not lose itself in chaos Hence a creation that
1s always in process of realisation, an energy always
freshly constructive, the unceasing labour of spiritual
incarnation Thus the human personality forms itself
by itself, like the embryo, and the child becomes the
creator of the man, the father of the man

CHAPTER It

MIND IN THE MAKING
THE SENSITIVE PERIODS

THE sensibility of the very young baby, before it has
animated its mstruments of expression, leads to a pri-
mary mind fabric, which may remain ‘unapparent
‘There 1s somethung mystical in the idea that the
tumest baby has its mental hfe It might lead us to
contemplate the new-born infant in the same spirit as
that im which in religion we contemplate the Child

AD
THE SENSITIVE PERIODS

Jesus, as the incarnation of a God truly present in the
tiny body So, we mught magne, is a human soul,
Iudden in the tender, helpless body of a baby, a soul
already developed and sensible, albeit dumb
But this conception is not a true one It would be
the same as saying that the new-born child has already
within itself a fully formed language, but that the motor
organs of speech are as yet umpotent to express it
What exists 1s a predisposition to construct a language
And something of the same holds good m respect of
the whole psychological complexus of which language
1s the outward manifestation The baby has a crea-
tive aptitude, a potential energy that will enable it to
build up a mental world from the world about it In
this 1t will be exposed to hindering encounters, to a
struggle for mental existence, which though uncon-
scious 1s none the less real, with mexorable conse-
quences as regards the final success of its achievement
If no one helps it, if an environment 1s not prepared
to receive it, it 1s a creature in continual perl from the
pot of view of its psychic life. The little child 1s,
we mght say, exposed, a waif in the world
In the course of its psychological development the
baby achieves things so marvellous as to be muracu-
lous, and it 1s only habit that makes us indifferent
spectators However, does such a child, come forth
from nothing, onent itself in this complicated world ?
How does it come to distinguish one thing from an-
other, and by what prodigy does it succeed in learning
a language in its detailed particularity without a
teacher, simply by hving? It hves with simplicity and
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

yoy, without wearying, whereas a grown-up person
who has to onent himself in a new environment needs
so much assistance, and to learn a new language must
work hard, and even so will never attam the perfec-
tion with which he speaks the mother tongue he learn-
ed in infancy

Only recently has it been possible for us to ask
ourselves on what does such development depend, and
how does a living creature grow

When we speak of development, of the growth of
consciousness, we speak of a fact that 1s outwardly
apparent, but only recently have we come to know
anything of its immer mechamsm = Modern science
has facilitated such investigations in two ways The
one 1s by the study of the endocrine glands which
affect growth, the discovery of which aroused an imme-
diate and widespread interest m view of their immense
practical influence on the care of children The other
1s the study of the sensitive pertods, which throws great
hight on psychic development.

It was the Dutch scientist, Hugo de Vries, who dis-
covered the existence of sensitive periods in animal
life, but we ourselves, in our schools and by observing
the life of children in thew families, were the first to
discover the sensitive periods of infancy, and to make
use of them from the standpoint of education

‘These periods correspond to special sensibilities to
be found in creatures in process of development , they
are transitory, and confined to the acquisition of a
determmed characteristic Once this characteristic
has evolved, the corresponding sensibility disappears

dA
THE SENSITIVE PERIODS

Thus every characteristic 1s established by the help of
an impulse, of a transient sensibility which lasts over a
lunited pertod of growth, that 1s, during the corespond-
ing sensitive period

Growth 1s thus not something vague, an inexorable
innate heredity, but a labour guided meticulously by
transitory instincts which bring an urge to determined
activities, and these often differ strikingly from those
of the same individual at an adult stage

In biology these periods were first studied by De
Vnies, and are particularly apparent in living creatures
that reach thew adult state through metamorphoses,
as in the case of insects We may take, for mstance,
the butterfly caterpillar It must feed on very tender
leaves, and yet the butterfly Jays its eggs in the most
hidden fork of the branch, near the trunk of the tree
Who will show the httle caterpillars ludden there, the
moment they leave the egg, that the tender leaves they
need are to be found at the extreme tip of the branch,
m the light? Now the caterpillar 1s strongly sensible
to hight ; light attracts it, summons it as by an irresis-
tible voice, fascinates it, and the caterpillar goes
wniggling towards where the hght is bnghtest, til it
reaches the tip of the branch, and thus finds itself,
famished for food, among the budding leaves that can
give it nourishment It 1s a strange fact that when the
caterpillar has passed through its first stage and 1s full
grown, it can eat other food, and then loses its sensi-
bility to ght This has been proved im _ scientific
laboratories where there are neither trees nor leaves
but only the caterpillar and the hght The caterpillar

45
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

will wriggle rapidly towards any ray of hght that comes
through a hole m the dark box in which it has been
enclosed for the expermment After a certain period,
rays of hight leave it completely mdifferent This
instinct no longer functions The caterpillar goes
other ways, seeks other means of hfe

A like active sensibility all at once transforms the
caterpillar, once so greedy m its destruction of fine
plants, into a kind of fasting fakir Fastmg mgor-
ously, it builds a sort of sarcophagus in which it will
remain as though lifeless, and this labour 1s intense
and uresistble © So entombed, it will prepare the
final phase, the butterfly with its beauty and bright
wings

It 1s well known that in the grubs of the bee there
3s a period in which all the females could become
queens But the community chooses one among their
number, and for her alone the worker bees make a
food substance called by zoologists “ royal jelly,”
which she greedily devours Thus the privileged bee,
by her royal banquets, becomes the queen of a com-
munity If, when a certam time has passed, the bees
wished to choose another female grub and were to
feed it on the finest royal jelly, t could never become
a queen, the period of mtense hunger has passed, and
its body 1s no longer capable of such development.

These facts may guide us to an understandmg of
the crux of the question, even where the human child
1s concerned The great difference hes between an
amimatmg impulse leading to the performance of won-
derful, staggering actions, and an indifference that

46
THE SENSITIVE PERIODS

brings blindness and meptitude The adult can do
nothing from the outside that will affect these different
states

The child makes a number of acquisitions during
the sensitive periods, which place him im relation to
the outer world in an exceptionally intense manner
Then all 1s easy, all 1s eagerness and hfe, every effort
1s an mcrease of power But when some of these
psychic passions die away, other flames are kindled,
and so infancy passes from conquest to conquest, in
a contiuous vital vibrancy, which we have called its
Joy and simphcity It is through this lovely flame that
burns without consuming that the work of creating the
mental world of man takes place

Thus the exaltng vitality of the child explains the
mnracles of natural conquest to be observed in psychic
growth

Thus what we have called “incarnation” and the
sensitive periods mght be compared to a spy-hole
opening on the inner processes of mind in the making,
so that we see, as it were internal organs at work,
determining the mental growth of the child

It thus becomes clear to us that psychic develop-
ment does not come about by hazard, and does not
onginate in stimul: from the outer world , it 1s guided
by transient sensibilities, temporary instincts connec-
ted with the acquisition of certain characteristics
Though this development takes place by means of the
outer world, the latter has no constructive significance
It merely provides the necessary means of psychic life,
just as the body, by eatyng and breathing, takes from

AT
JHE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

its outer environment the necessary means of physical
hfe

The mner sensibilities we have mentioned deter-
mune the selection of necessary things from a many-
faceted environment, and of circumstances favourable
to development This guidance 1s exercised by
making the child sensitive only towards certain things,
leaving him indifferent towards others When be 1s
sensible of something, it 1s as if a light came from hun,
illummating that and no other, and of such things his
world is made But it 1s not a question only of an
intense desire to find himself in given situations, or
to absorb given elements The child has a special,
unique capacity for profiting by these in order to grow,
for it 1s during the sensitive period that he acquires
certain psychological faculties, lke that of omenting
tumself in his outer environment, and becomes able
to bring his motor organs to life in all their mtmate
and delicate particulars

In these sense-relations between the child and his
environment hes the key to the mysterious recess mm
which the spiritual embryo achieves the muracles of
growth.

We may unagine this marvellous creative activity as
a series of keen emotions, rising up from the subcon-
scious, and which, by contact with the outer world,
build up human consciousness Starting from con-
fusion, they reach distinction, then create activity, as,
for example, un the achievement of speech In the
beginning, the sounds of the environment are confu-
sion and chaos, indistmguishable, and then, all at once,

48
THE SENSITIVE PERIODS

they are heard as distinct, alluring, fascinating, the
separate sounds of an incomprehensible but articulate
language, and the mind, as yet without thought, hears
a kind of music that fills the world Then the very
fibres of the baby are stirred, not all its fibres, but only
those that must now play their part, and which had
previously remamed hidden, wbratmg only in un-
regulated cries Now they waken in a regular motion,
disciplined, ordered, which changes their manner of
vibration, and thus a new rhythm 1s prepared for the
cosmos of the spiritual embryo = But 1 itself lives
intensely in its present, and is all concentrated in the
present , the glory of its future bemg remams unknown
to it

Little by little the ear discerns sound and the tongue
too 1s ammated to new movement , hitherto it merely
played its part m sucking, but now it begins to feel
an inward vibration, and is drawn, as though by an
irresistible force, to seek the throat, the lps, the
cheeks These vibrations are life, but as yet they
Setve no purpose, save to bring an ineffable pleasure.

A sensitive period 1s at work, a divine command 1s
breathing through helpless things, anmmating them with
the spint.

This inner drama in a baby’s life is a drama of love
Love in its widest sense 1s the sole great reality, which
evolves in the hidden recesses of the soul, and from
time to time fills 1t wholly These marvellous activi-
tes do not pass away without leaving indelible traces,
by which the man will be the greater, and which give

49
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

hum the higher characteristics that will accompany him
all Ins life , they take place m humble silence

This is why all happens quietly and mmperceptibly,
so long as the conditions of the outer environment
correspond sufficiently to the child’s mner needs In
the case of speech, for instance, which 1s the hardest
of all these processes of animation, and which corres-
ponds to the longest of the sensitive periods, it hes
secret because the child is always surrounded by
people who speak and therefore provide him with
the necessary elements for his achievement. The only
outward mdication of a baby’s sensitive state 1s its
smile, its evident joy when we address it directly in
short, clearly pronounced words, so that it can dis-
tinguish the sounds as we distinguish a peal of bells
Or we see it grow tranquil in beatific peace, when, of
an evening, a grown-up sings a lullaby, usmg always
the same words , it 1s in such a state of delight that it
leaves the conscious world for the world of dreams
It 1s because we know this, that we talk to the baby
with caressing words, to earn its smile, which 1s so
full of life , it is in this knowledge that from time mm-
memorial people have gone of evenings to their babies,
who want and demand words and music with the

urgency of those askmg a comfort on the pomt of
death

Here are positive proofs of the child’s creative
sensibility

But there are other, far more apparent proofs, which
have a negative significance We see them when some

50
4
THE SENSITIVE PERIODS

external circumstance opposes the child’s mward, sec-
ret working, bringing violent disturbance and defor-
mation, and resulting m defects that will remain
throughout life If the baby has not been able to
work m accordance with the guidance of its sensitive
period, it has lost 1ts chance of a natural conquest, and
has lost it for ever

When something in its environment hinders its inner
working, the existence of a sensitive period shows itself
by violent reactions, a despair that we believe to be
causeless, and therefore set down to “ naughtmess ”
and temper Naughtiness 1s the expression of an inner
disturbance, an unsatisfied need, a state of tension ,
the child’s soul 1s crying out for what it needs, seeking
to defend itself

This shows itself in an increase of useless and rest-
less activity comparable on the physical plane to the
high fevers to which babies are able without any pro-
Portionate pathological cause We know that babies
often have alarmingly high temperature with small ail-
ments that would hardly affect the normal state of a
grown-up person—and which disappear as quickly as
they arse In the same way im the psychological field
we find violent agitation due to infinitesimal causes,
Corresponding to a baby’s exceptional sensibility
These reactions have always been known, and indeed
the tempers small children show almost from buth
used to be judged as proofs of the innate perversity
of human nature Well, if every disturbance of func-
tion 1s considered a functional disease, we must call
the disturbances that affect the psychic side of life

Si
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

functional disease also The first “naughtmess” of
the baby 1s the first sickness of the soul

These violent reactions have been observed because
pathological facts are always the first to be noted, it
3s not tranquillity but the loss of tranquillity that pre-
sents itself as a problem demanding thought The
plamest things m nature are not its Jaws but its aberra-
tons Thus no one notices the umperceptible outward
signs of the creative working of hfe, or of the functions
that subsequently maintam it The facts of creation
and conservation remam hidden In the functioning
of the body the mechanism of the internal organs 1s
something truly wonderful, but no one sees 1t or notices
it, The very mdividual who lives by them 1s unaware
of their stupendous orgamtsation Nature works with-
out lettmg st be known, and we call the harmonious
balance of combmed energies health, normality
Health! It means trumph m every detail, the
trumph of purpose over causes

We take objective note of all the details of sickness,
while the laborious wonders of health may remam un-
perceived, unknown It 1s a fact that im the lustory
of medicine diseases have been known from earhest
times We find traces of surgical treatment left by
prehistoric man, while the origins of medicine go back
to the civilisations of Greece and Egypt. But the dis-
covery of the functions of the internal Organs 1s very
recent. That of the circulation of the blood was made
im the XVIth century, while the first anatomical dis-
section of a human body with a view to studying its
internal organs took place in 1600 It was pathology,

~ 52

THE CARE REQUIRED

that 1s to say, disease, that indirectly led to the dis-
covery of the secrets of physiology, that 1s to say, of
normal functions

It is therefore no wonder that men have been aware
only of the psychic maladies of the child, and that
the normal working of its soul has remamed in com-
plete obscunty And this is all the more understand-
able because of the extreme delicacy of such psychic
functions, which work m darkness, mm secret, without
possibility of mamfestation

It 1s therefore startling but not absurd to say that
the adult has known only the diseases of the child
psyche not its health The healthy psyche remamed
hidden, like all the forces of the umverse yet to be
discovered

If this be so, if we must reckon the baby as among
the hidden forces still a secret from us, and if its psy-
chic life develops on a background of functional dis-
harmony and sickness, a vast amount of deformation
is bound to result, with blindness, weakness, arrested
development This 1s not an imaginary picture, but
a very present reality. Small causes near the beginn-
ings of Ife may lead to grave deviation , man grows
and matures under a typical aspect other than his own.

THE CARE REQUIRED

The adult gives no help because he does not even
know of the effort the baby must put forth, and there-
fore does not recognise the muracle that 1s taking place,
the muracle of creation from nothing, performed appa-
tently by a being without psychic hfe.
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

This conception bnngs with it a new mode of treat-
ing the baby, which has hitherto been considered
merely as a vegetating little body, with urgent need
of physical care but nothing more To-day what
should prevail 1s an attitude of expectation of the mam-
festations of mind, im our care of the child we must
consider not only what exists but what 1s still to come
The adult must no longer remain blind to the psychic
Teality im process of actualisation even in the new-born
infant , he must follow its early developments and en-
courage them He has not to help the baby to form
itself, for this 1s nature’s task, but he must show a deli-
cate respect for its manifestations, providing it with
what it needs for its making and could not procure for
itself In short, the adult must continue to provide a
suitable environment for the psychic embryo, just as
nature, in the guide of the mother, provided a sutable
environment for the physical embryo

To prove the exstence of psychic hfe mn the tumest
child we have no need of scientific experiments, as these
are understood by experimental psychology, and such
as have been attempted by certain modern psycho-~
logists who by presenting sensory stimuli to the child
try to attract his attention, in expectation of such motor
Teactions as would indicate a psychic response

Here, in the first place, 1s a fact that could not be
proved, save at a stage (which may indeed fall within
the first year of hfe), when a psychic co-ordination of
the organs of movement has already been achieved,
that 1s to say, when the Process of ammation or incat-
nation 1s in full swing Whereas there must necessarily

54
THE CARE REQUIRED

be a psychic life, however embryonic, antecedent to any
animation of voluntary movement, precisely because it
1s the psyche that anumates such movement

The carhest form of animation is produced by a
feeling | Thus, for example, as Levine has shown in
hus psychological films, the child who wants something
first throws himself upon it with his whole body, and
only much later, with the progress of co-ordination of
his motor organs, can he separate one action from
another, and, for instance, stretch out his hand to take
what he wants

Another example 1s that of a child of four months,
who likes to watch the mouth of a speaker, and ex-
Presses himself with vague, soundless movements of
his lips, but above all by the look of keen attention on
his face, that shows him wholly absorbed by the inter-
esting phenomenon before him = Nonetheless, it 1s
Only at six months that he begins to pronounce even
a syllable Thus before the earhest articulate utter-
ance, there existed in the child a sensible interest, stor-
ing up sounds, secretly preparing the animation of the
Organs of speech , prior to the act, there was an ami-
mating psychic factor Such sensibihties are subjects
for observation but not for experiment Indeed such
experiments as have been attempted by the experimental
Psychologists might be among those external circums-
tances that can damage the secret labour of the mfant
psyche, calling forth constructive energies before due
time

Tke psychic life of the baby must be observed as
Fabre observed his insects, going in search of them to
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

surprise them im their natural environments, and lying
hidden so as not to disturb them And we must begin
with the tame m which the senses, like prehensile organs,
begin to seize and accumulate conscious impressions
of the outer world, for from that moment a hfe is
spontaneously evolving at the expense of its outer en-
vironment

In order to help the child it 1s not necessary to
develop extraordinary powers of observation, or to be
able to imterpret it Something much simpler will
suffice it ts enough to have a mind prepared to assist
the hidden mind of the child Then common sense
will suffice to make us her followers

The care demanded 1s both simple and practical,
as I will show by a few examples It 1s believed, to
begin with something very common, that since the baby
cannot sit up it must always he flat Thus its first
sensory relations with its environment must be made
with the sky rather than with the earth, but the sight
of the sky 1s yust what 1s withheld from it In reality
it hes looking up at the nursery ceiling, which 1s usually
white and smooth, or at the canopy of its perambulator
And yet it is through sight that the first impressions
must be obtamed, to nourish the hungry spirit

Those who had a notion that the baby needed
something to look at thought of putting objects in front
of it, rather than of Temoving it from the mistaken
conditions isolatmg it from its environment Acting
in the same way as the experimental psychologists, such
well-meaning people would tie a string of balls or other
coloured objects m front of its cradle The baby,

56
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

eager to take m or rather to devour images of its
environment, follows with its eyes the balls or toys
dancing in front of it, twisting itself in an unnatural
effort This deforming effort is forced upon it by an
artificial offermg crude mm form and movement. It
would be enough to put the baby somewhere high, on
a shghtly inclined plane, so that it could dominate at
least the environment of its room But it could be
put in the same way in a garden where the mpple of
leaves, flowers, and the leaping and running of anumals
would form for it a hving panorama

It 1s necessary that for a long time the scenes of the
baby’s explorations should be the same Thus seeing
the same things it learns to recogmse them, finding
them always in the same place, while it learns to dis-
tinguish the movements of things moved by the air
from the movements of living creatures

ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

A baby only a month old had never been out of
the house His nurse was holding him on her lap
when his father and an uncle hving in the house
appeared before him together Both men were more
or less the same height and the same age The baby
made a start of intense surprise and almost of fear
The two men stayed in front of him, but separated, one
moving to the right and the other to the left. The
baby turned to gaze at one of them with plain anxiety,
and after a long look at him smiled But all at once
his expression again became anxious, and more than
anxious, fnghtened With a swift movement he turned

37
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

hus head to stare at the other, and only after gazing at
jum for a long ume again smiled He repeated this
passage from anxiety to smiles, and those movements
of his head from nght to left quite twenty tumes before
light dawned im his little bram, and he realised that
there were nvo men They were the only men he had
seen Both had made a fuss of him, had nursed him,
and spoken affectionate words to hum, and he had
understood the fact that there was a different kind of
bemg from the many women who surrounded him
He had understood that the world held a different kind
of human being from his mother, his nurse, and the
various women whom he had had occasion to notice,
but never having seen the two men together he had
evidently formed the idea that there was only one man
Hence hus fnght when he suddenly realised that the
being he had so laboriously catalogued out of chaos
had become double

A characteristic of very small babies 1s their love
of order Babies of a year and a half or two show
clearly something that shows itself obscurely even
earlier , they need order m thew surroundmgs This
love of order cannot be compared to that of a good
housewife who declares, “I love my hofaé, I love to
have it always tidy” She 1s only talking, but the
small baby cannot hve m disorder Disorder disturbs
hum, upsets him, and he may express his suffermg by
despawmg cnes, or by an agitation that can even
assume the forms of illness The small baby 1s umme-
diately aware of a disorder that grown-ups and even
bigger children pass by without perceiving. Order mm

58
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

ius outer environment evidently affects a sensibility
that vanishes as he grows bigger It 1s therefore pre-
cisely one of those periodic sensibilities proper to
creatures in process of development and which we call
“sensitive periods” , it 1s one of the most important
and most mysterious of such periods

It may seem extraordinary or far-fetched to say that
children pass through a sensitive period m regard to
external order, when everyone believes that children
are untidy by nature The cause of this contradiction
les in the fact that the baby 1s unable to show his
dispositions in an environment that is not his own, and
of which the master 1s a being stronger than he, namely
the adult, who does not understand him, and by his
lights considers him a creature of caprice But how
often have we not seen a baby crying desperately, with-
out reason, that 1s, capriciously? How often have we
not seen small babies crying mconsolably? In the
soul of the baby there are secrets still hidden from the
adult

But it 1s only necessary to drop a hint, to give a
word of guidance as to the existence of these secret
needs, for the adult to become at once aware of them,
and then he wall see how the child soul reveals them

In our schools, if anything 1s out of its place, it 1s
the t\o-year-old child who notices it and puts it back.
‘This does not often happen, because as a rule children
of two do not come to school. It 1s also necessary
that children should tearn the habit of keeping every-
thing in its place, as happens in our schools where
nearly all superfuous objects are elimmated More-

59
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

over, in order to reveal such tendencies, children must
have freedom

A considerable public was able to observe such
phenomena as these in our glass school built i the
hall of the central building of the San Francisco Exhi-
bition the year of the openmg of the Panama Canal
There was a child of two who, after school, put all the
chairs back in their places along the walls He seemed
to be pondermg durmg his work One day, leaning
against a big chair, he seemed uncertam, went away,
and then came back and put it a little apart from the
others , here deed was the usual place for the big
chair

Another time, a bigger child, of about four, m
pouring water from one receptacle to another, let some
drops fall on the floor without noticmg it. A tiny child
took a rag, sat down on the floor and wiped up the
drops as they fell, without the bigger child’s paying
attention When the drops of water ceased, the little
one asked, “Haven’t you any more?” “More what ?”
asked the bigger one, in surprise

But if an environment has not been prepared and
the baby finds himself among grown-ups, these in-
teresting manifestations, which express themselves so
peacefully, may become misery, an enigma, naughti-
ness

In order to surprise a positive symptom of this
sensibility mm small babies, such a symptom as an ex-
pression of joy and enthusiasm when their need is satis-
fied, it 1s necessary for the adult to have studied this
aspect of infant psychology, and all the more because

60
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

the sensitive period of order shows itself in the first
months of life Only nurses trained on our principles
can give mstances of it I can give an example of a
nurse who noticed that as she was wheeling a five-
months-old baby in its perambulator slowly through the
grounds of its home, it showed special interest and joy
at the sight of a white marble tablet mset in a grey,
old wali Though the grounds were full of lovely
flowers the little girl always seemed to grow excited and.
pleased when they came near the tablet The nurse
therefore every day stopped the perambulator in front
of it, though it seemed the last thing that could give
permanent pleasure to a baby so newly born

There are, on the other hand, hindrances through
which it 1s easier to perceive the existence of a sensitive
period , perhaps the majority of cases of precocious
temper arise from such sensibilities

I will give a few examples taken from real hfe
Here is a little family scene , The baby im question,
only a few months old, was accustomed to le on a high,
Oblique bed, so as to dominate its environment. Its
room was not the usual white, washable nursery on
physically hygienic principles , it was hygienic psycholo-
gically There were coloured panes in the windows,
a few pretty pieces of furmture, flowers, and among
other things, a table with a yellow tablecloth, on which
stood a plant. One day a visitor came in and put her
umbrella on the table The baby girl began to grow
excited, and the umbrella was certainly the cause, for
after staring at it, she began to cry It was thought
that this meant that she wanted the umbrella, which

61
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

was brought to her, but she pushed it away The um-
brella was put back on the table, and the nurse gently
carried the baby to it, and put her down on the table
by the umbrella, but she only cried and struggled the
more The unmitiated would have taken this reaction
for one of those precocious fits of temper that show
themselves from buth But the baby’s mother, who
knew something of a child’s early psychological symp-
toms, took the umbrella from the table and carried it
out of the room Immediately, the child grew calm
The reason for her agitation was that the umbrella on
the table was mn the wrong place, and this violently
disturbed the usual picture of the position of things in
an order that the child needed to remember

Here 1s another example The child im this case
was much bigger, about a year and a half old, and
i myself played an active part mm the scene

I found myself one day with a group of people
going through Nero’s grotto at Naples With us was
a young mother with a child, too small to be able to
walk the whole length of the subterranean passage
which goes nght through a hill, he seemed about a
year and a half old In fact, after a time, he grew
tired, and his mother picked him up, but she had over-
estimated her strength She was hot and stopped to
take off her coat to carry it on her arm, and with this
impediment once more picked up the child, who began
to cry, his screams growing louder and louder His
mother strove in vain to quiet him She was plainly
tied out and began to grow cross Indeed, the noise
was getting on the nerves of all, and naturally others

&
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

offered to carry him He passed from arm to arm,
struggling and screaming, and everyone talked to him
and scolded him, but he only grew worse

\ It looked as if his mother would have to carry him
after all, but now he had reached a state of what we
call real naughtiness, and the position seemed hopeless
The guide let himself go so far as to exclaim : “Madam,
how ever could your husband think of leaving you
alone with a child hke this? Give him tome!” And
he took the child in Ins sturdy arms with vigorous
severity, at which the struggles grew really violent.

I thought of the engima of infancy, of how reactions
must always have a cause, and going up to the mother
I said, “Will you allov me to help you put on your
coat?” She looked at me m amazement, for she was
stil hot, but in her confusion she consented and allow-
ed me to help her on with it. At once the baby
quieted down, his tears and struggles stopped, and he
said, “Mamma, coat on”. It was as uf he wanted to
say, “Yes, Mamma, a coat is meant to be worn,” as
though he thought, “At last you have understood me,”
and, stretching out his arms to his mother, he came
back to her all smiles The expedition ended in com-
plete tranquillity. A coat is meant to be worn, and
not to hang hke a rag over one arm, and this disorder
m his mother’s person had affected the child as a
jarring disturoance

I was present at another family scene that was most
Wuminating. The mother, who was feeling ul, was
sitting, or rather lying, on a sofa, on which the nurse
had put two cushions, and her hitle girl of wventy-one

63
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

months stood by her asking for a “story” What
mother could resist such a plea? Jil as she was, she
began a story, the little gurl listenmg with an mtent
expression But the mother felt so ul that she could
not continue , she had to get up and be helped to bed
in a neighbourmg room The child cried, chnging to
the sofa Everyone thought it natural for her to cry,
from fright, they thought, and grief at her mother’s
illness, and they tned to calm her, but when the nurse
wanted to take the two cushions from the sofa to carry
them into the other room, the child began to scream,
“Not cushions, not cushions’ As though she meant,
“At least something must stay in its place |”

‘The child herself was carried with caresses and com-
forting words to her mother’s bed, and her mother, in
spite of her wlness, made an effort to go on with the
story, thinking that thus she would console her But
the child, sobbing, her face bathed in tears, went on
repeating, “Mamma, sofa ”

‘The story no longer interested her Her mother and
the cushions had changed their place, the story begun
in one room was ending in another, and the conflict in
the child’s mind was dramatic and irreparable

These examples show the intensity of the imstinct
of order, and, what is equally surprising, its extreme
precocity In children in their third year the need for
order has entered upon a phase of calm, merging into
the active, tranquil period of its applications Indeed,
one of the most interesting things we notice m our
schools 1s that, as we have said, if anything 1s out of
Place, it is the child of two who notices it and puts it

64
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

back He still feels small details of disorder, which
adults or even older children do not notice If, for
sstance, a piece of soap is left on the wash-stand in-
stead of in the soap-dish, or a chair 1s put crooked or
in the wrong place, the child of two sees it and goes to
put it right Disorder seems to present an exciting
stimulus, an active summons, but it 1s more than this ,
to put things tidy brings real enjoyment Indeed, we
notice in our schools that even much bigger children,
of three and four, when they have finished a game or
exercise put everything back in its place, and this task
1s plainly as spontaneous and enjoyable as any

Order—thmgs in their place It means a know-
ledge of the arrangement of objects in the child’s sur-
roundings, a recollection of the place where each
belongs And this means that he can orient himself m
his environment, possess it im all its details We
mentally possess an environment when we know it so
as to find our way with our eyes shut, and find all we
want within hands’ reach Such a place is essential
for the tranquillity and happiness of life

Plainly, the child’s love of order 1s something more
than what the adult means by the words It 1s a vital
need at a certain age, in which disorder 1s painful and
is felt as a wound in the depths of the soul, so that the
child might say, “I cannot lve unless I have order
about me” It 1s mdeed a question of life and death
For the grown-up it is only a question of external
pleasure, of a more or less indifferent comfort But
the child makes lumself out of the clements of his envi-
ronment, and this self-making is not accomplished by

65
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

some vague formula, but following a precise and defi-
mite guidance The guidance of nature enforces its
programme and its time-table by a formidable discipline
im which health and sickness, hfe and death play their
part. For the tiny child order 1s like the plane or
which terrestrial begs must rest 1f they are to go for-
ward , 1t 1s what water 1s to the fish It 1s necessary
that at an early age the child should acquire the
elements of orientation m the environment in which his
spirit must go forward to further conquests
Pecubarities of this passion for order are revealed
inachild’s games Professor Plaget, the Swiss psycho-
logist, who holds the post once held by Professor Clapa-
rede at Geneva, has made interesting expermments with
ius own children He would hide something under the
cushion of an armchair and then, having sent away the
child, transfer it under the cushion of an armchair
opposite His idea was that the child would look for
the object, having failed to find st in its omginal place,
and to make the search easier, the Professor had put it
im a similar hiding place But the child confined itself
to pullmg away the cushion from the first chair, saying
im hus baby language, “It’s not there now” The ex-
pected response, a search for the vanished object, failed
to follow The Professor repeated the experiment, but
this time he allowed the child to see him carry the
object from one chair to the other © The child, how-
ever, repeated the same act as before, with the same
comment, “Not there ” The Professor was about to
conclude his son was stupid, and almost impatiently
raised the cushion of the second chair, saying, “ Didn’t

66
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

you see me put it here?” “ Yes,” replied the child,
pointing to the first chair, “ but it ought to be here ”

The child had no idea of looking for anything ; this
did not concern him, what concerned him was that the
thing should return to its place, and perhaps he in his
turn concluded that the Professor did not understand
the game Was not the game simply to carry away
something and then to put it back m its place? The
“Inding” of which his father spoke just meant that
the thing was put out of sight under a cushion But if
the thing was not put back, what was the point of the
game ?

I, too, experienced great astonishment when I began
to play with very small children (between two and
three years old) at what was meant to be hide-and-
seek, In games of this kind children are always keen,
happy and highly expectant, so were these Their
Same consisted m this one child, in the presence of
the others, hid under a table that was covered by a long
tablecloth, then all the others went out, came back, and
hfted up the tablecloth with shrieks of delight at the
discovery of their playmate hiding underneath This
they repeated again and again Each one said, * Now
Til inde,” and crawled under the tablecloth Another
ume I saw much bigger children playing with a little
one They put the little one to hide behind a piece of
furniture and, coming back, pretended not to see him
and to hunt for him everywhere Whereupon the hittle
one called out, “ I’m here!” with the tone of one who
would say, “ But didn’t you see where I was 2”

One day I myself joined in such a game I found

67
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

a group of little ones shouting for joy and clapping their
hands because they had found a playmate hidden behind
a door, and they crowded round me, pleading, “ Play
with us You hide!” Iagreed They all ran out,
Just as though they did not want to see where I would
go Instead of gomg behind the door, I chose a dark
comer behind a wardrobe When the children came
back they all ran to look for me behmd the door I
waited a little, and then, seeing that they would not
look for me, I came out of my hiding-place The
children were all disappointed and downcast. Why
wouldn’t you play with us ?” they asked reproachfully,
“Why didn’t you hide ?”

If it 1s true that the aim of a game 1s pleasure (and
indeed these children thoroughly enjoyed repeating
the absurd mte), we must recognise that at a certam
age children take special pleasure in finding things back
1n the places where they have been put To hide some-

Alice Meynell gives a charming description of the same
fact. Little children, she says, “are not eager, for a year or
tWwo yet to come, for surprises. If you hide and they cannot
see you hiding, their joy in finding you 1s comparatively small ,
‘but let them know perfectly well what cupboard you are in,
and they will find you with shouts of discovery The better
the biding-place 1s understood between you the more lively the
drama, They make a convention of art for their play The
younger the children the more dramatic , and when the house
4s filled with outcries of laughter from the breathless breast of
a child, it 1s that he is pretending to be surprised at finding
his mother where he bade her pretend to hide This 1s the
comedy that never tires Let the elder who cannot understand
the charm beware how he tries to put a more intelligible form
of dehght m the place of it, for, if not, he will find that
children also have a manner of substitution, and that they will
put half-hearted laughter in the Place of their natura! impetuous
clamours "—From The Unready  Translator’s Note

68
ORIENTATION THROUGH ORDER

thing means for them to put it somewhere out of sight,
where its rediscovery brings a sense of order not only
in what can be seen but m what cannot be seen, so
that they can say to themselves, “You can’t see it, but
1 know where it 1s, I can find something with my eyes
shut, be sure of the place where it has been put ”
Nature gives small children an mtrmsic sensibility to
order, as built up by an mner sense which is a sense not
of distinction between things but of distinction of the
relationship between things, so that it perceives an
environment as a whole with interdependent parts
Only in such an environment, known as a whole, 1s it
possible for the child to onent himself and to act with
purpose , without it he would have no basis on which
to build his perception of relationship It would be
like having furniture without a house to putitin = What
would be the use of an accumulation of external umages
without the order that brings them into organised rela-
tion? If man knew only separate objects and not their
relations, he would find himself in an inextricable con-
fuston It 1s to the child’s labours that man owes the
faculty, which seems a gift of nature of orienting him-
self, of finding his way about, im the world. In the
sensitive period of order, nature gives the first lesson,
in the same way as a teacher will show a child a plan of
the classroom, to prepare him for the study of geogra-
phical maps Or we may say that by this first lesson
nature has given man a compass to orient him in the
world In the same way she gives the small child the
power of exact reproduction of the sounds that make
up language, that language that 1s capable of infinite

69
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

development, and which the adult will evolve through
the ages Man’s mind does not spnng from nothing ,
1s built up on the foundations laid by the child in his
sensitive periods

INWARD ORIENTATION

The child’s sensibility to order has two simultaneous
aspects , the outer, that concerns relations between the
parts of his environment, the inner, which gives him a
sense of the parts of his body, their movements and
position This latter aspect we may call his mner
orientation

This mner ortentation has been the subject of much
research Experimental psychologists speak of a mus-
cular sense which allows the child to become aware of
the position of his various members, and which deter-
munes a special memory—muscular memory This
explanation has been made the basis of a purely mecha-
nical theory, founded on the experience of conscious
movements If, for example, we move our arm to
seize something, we are aware of this movement, memo-
mse and can repeat it

But the child has proved, on the contrary, the exist-
ence of a highly developed sensitive period in respect
of the positions of his body long before he can move
freely and make any experiments That 1s to say,
nature prepares a special sensibility towards the apti-
tudes and positions of the body

The old theones dealt with the nervous mechamsm,
but the sensitive periods concern psychological events,
spiritual Wummations and vibrations, which prepare the

70
INWARD ORIENTATION

way for consciousness They are energies starting from
non-existence, to bring to existence the basic elements
from which the child’s psychic world will eventually be
constructed. ‘These possibilities originate as a gift of
nature, and conscious experiments only develop them
further

We find negative proofs not only of the existence
but of the keenness of this sensitive period when in the
child’s environment circumstances hinder the tranquil
evolution of his creative conquests Then the child
falls a prey to acute and often violent agitation, which
shows itself not only as temper and crying-fits, but may
appear as ulnesses which, if the unfavourable carcum-
stances are not removed, defy all attempts at cure
Whereas, the moment the obstacle 1s removed, temper
and illness both vanish, a clear proof of the cause of the
abnormal phenomena,

An interesting example was reported to me by an
English nurse Since she had to make a short absence
from the family who had engaged her, she left in her
place an equally skilled nurse to look after the baby.
This nurse found her task easy, till it came to bath~
tume Then the baby became unmanageable It not
only screamed, but struggled to get out of the nurse's
arms The nurse meanwhile took the very greatest
care in the preparation of the bath, butin vain = Little
by little the baby came to hate the sight of her When
its first nurse came back, it was perfectly good and
quiet, and seemed to enjoy its bath This nurse had
been tramed on our principles, and was therefore in-
terested in finding the psychological factor, in discover-

WW
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

ing what enigma of infancy would explain the pheno-
mena that had occurred With great patience she tried
to mterpret the imperfect words uttered by a baby at
such an early age She discovered two things The
baby considered the second nurse naughty, and why ?
Because she bathed it the wrong way round The two
nurses, comparing notes, found that whereas the first
took the child with her nght hand under its head and
her left under its feet, the second nurse did the opposite,
supporting its head by her left hand and its feet by her
night It thus felt that its head was bemg put at the end
of the bath where it was accustomed to put its feet
I once found myself mvolved in a pathological case

I was not called m directly as doctor, but I was a witness
to all that happened A famuly had just arrived from
a very long journey, and one of the children was too
small to stand the stram—or rather, that was the opi-
mon of all concerned Its mother, however, said that
on the journey everything had gone smoothly They
had spent the nights at very good hotels, where every-
thmg had been prepared for them, with food and a
proper cradle for the baby They were now staying in
a comfortable furnished flat , there was no cradle, but
the baby slept m a big bed with its mother _ Its illness.
had begun by restlessness at night and digestive trouble

At might it had to be walked up and down, for its
screams were thought to come from bowel pains

Specialists had been consulted, and one had prescribed
modern foods with a high vitamin content, which were
prepared with scrupulous care Sunbaths, fresh air
treatment, and all the most modern physical methods

72
INWARD ORIENTATION

had failed to give any rehef The baby was growing
worse and the nights were despairing vigils for the whole
family. Finally, convulsions set in The baby, when
in bed, wnithed in alarmmg spasms These convulsions
began to occur two or three times a day. The baby
was still too small to speak, so the greatest aid in know-
ing 1ts trouble was wanting It was decided to call a
consultation with one of the most famous specialists in
nervous diseases of children It was then that I inter-
vened The child seemed healthy and from what its
parents said, had been healthy and quiet the whole
Journey The cause of its symptoms might therefore
be psychological—one of the emgmas of infancy.
Then, I had a sudden intution The baby was in the
big bed, in a fit of agitation I took two armchairs and
set them one in front of the other, so that they made a
kind of little bed, walled in by the arms, like a cradle ,
in it I put blankets and sheets, and without speaking,
I dragged it to the side of the bed The baby looked
atit, stopped crying, rolled over and over till it reached
the edge of the bed, and let itself drop into the impro-
vised cradle saying, “ Ulla, ulla ulla?’* And imme-
chately, it went to sleep The symptoms of illness never
tecurred It had been protesting, in its way, against a
hornble disorder—that of doing away with its bed and
putting it in a big bed made for grown-ups

Evidently the baby was sensible to the contact of a
small bed, enveloping its body, and giving support to
all 1ts members, while the big bed gave it no such
shelter. The result was a disorder in its inner orienta-

From “culta," Itahan for cradle

73
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

tion, and this disorder was the cause of the painful
conflict, which had brought it mto the hands of so many
doctors Such 1s the power of the sensitive periods
They have the mighty force of creative nature

The child does not feel order as we feel it, we have
already acquired a wealth of impressions and remain
indifferent to it, but the child 1s poor and comes from
nothing In all that he does, he starts from nothing ,
he knows only the Jabour of creation, and he leaves us
as his heirs We are like the sons of a man who has
amassed wealth by the sweat of his brow, and who
understand nothing of the struggles and labours that
fell to him We are ungrateful and cold, and adopt an
attitude of superiority because we are well provided
with everything and have our established place in
society It 1s enough for us to use the reason that child
developed for us, the will he built up, the muscles he
animated that we mught use them We find our way
about im the world because he endowed us with the
faculty to do so We feel ourselves because he pre-
pared such a sensibility We are rich, because we are
the heirs of the child, who drew all the foundations of
our life from nothing The child achteved the unmense
effort of the first step, the step from nothing to a begin-
ming He 1s so near to the very founts of life that he
acts for the sake of acting, for this 1s what happens on
the plane of creation, and he cannot make himself felt,
and he cannot cause himself to be remembered

THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE
The child has shown us that his understanding ts not

74
THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE

something slowly built up from outside Yet this has
been the conception of a mechanistic psychology, which
still exercises a major practical influence both on pure
science and on education, and thus on the care of the
child Psychologists of this school assert that the
images of external objects knock at the doors of sense,
and almost force their way in, to be transmitted by an
external impulse, till, on the psychical plane, they asso-
ciate, and, httle by little, falling into organised order,
build up the mind This presupposes that the child,
from the psychological standpoint, is wholly passive,
at the mercy of his enviconment, and therefore under
the complete control of the adult This idea 1s com-
Pleted by another commonly held postulate, that the
child from the psychical standpoint 1s not only passive,
but, as the old educationalists used to say, hke an
empty vessel, to be filled and moulded

Our own experiences assuredly do not lead us to
underrate the importance of environment in the build-
ing up of mind It 1s well known how our pedagogy
considers the environment so important as to make it
the central point of the whole system, while we give
to the child’s sense-life a more fundamental and syste-
mate consideration than any previous educational
method There 1s, however, a subtle difference between
the old concepuon of the child as passive and the real
facts This difference hes m the existence of the
child’s inner sensibility There is a Jong sensitive
period, lasting almost to the age of five, which gives the
child a truly prodigious capacity of possessing itself of
the umages of its environment The child is an obser-

75
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

ver who through his senses 1s actively absorbing images,
and this is very different from saying that he 1s able to
receive them lke a muror To be an observer implies
an mner impulse, determined by feelmg, by special
tastes, leading thus to a selection of certam images
rather than others This idea was illustrated by Wil-
liam James when he said that no one ever sees anything
in all its details, but everyone sees only a part, deter-
mined by his feelings and interests , 1t 1s for this reason
that various people will give different descriptions of
the same thing Of this James gives a witty example
If, he says, you are wearing a new suit which pleases
you, when you walk along the road you will pay special
attention to the clothes of well-dressed people, to such
an extent that you risk getting run over

Now the question mses, what are the interests of the
small baby, that will lead it to make a choice from
among the infinite medley of images that make up its
environment? It 1s self-evident that the baby will not
be affected by interests of an external origin, like those
quoted by James, for as yet st has had no experience
The baby starts from nothing, it 1s an active being going
forward by its own powers Let us go straight to the
Pomt. The axis round which the internal working of
the sensitive period revolves 1s reason Such reason-
ing must be looked upon as a natural, creative function,
that little by little buds and develops and assumes con-
crete form from the images it absorbs from its environ-
Ment.

Here 1s the irresistible force, the primordial energy
Images fall at once ito pattern in the service of reason

76
THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE

it is in the service of his reason that the child first
absorbs such umages He 1s hungry for them, and,
we may well say, insatiable It has always been known
that a baby 1s strongly attracted to light, colours, sounds,
im all of which he takes visible delight But what we
want to prove is the inner fact of a reason that exists
in a purely germ-state © There 1s no need for us to
underline how we should reverence and assist such
passing from nothingness to a begmning , he 1s bning-
ing into bemg the most precious gift which gives man
his superiority—reason. On this road he goes for-
ward, long before his tiny feet can carry forward his
body

An example 1s far more luminating than an argu-
ment, so I will recall the very striking one of the child
of four weeks old already quoted on pages 57-58.

In another environment where the grown-ups con-
cerned had had no idea of the psychical process at
work from birth, the event would have passed un-
noticed, and the baby would have been deprived of the
immense help which the two men gave him, by helping
him to take a most difficult step, to make an effort
towards the actualisation of consciousness

I should like to add examples taken from much big-
ger children There was, for instance, a baby seven
months old, who was sitting on the floor playing with
a cushion. On the cushion were printed figures of
flowers and children, and the little girl, with evident
delight, smelled the flowers and kissed the children
An ignorant servant, who was looking after her, inter-
preted this as meaning that the child hked to play at

Wt
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

smelling and kissing everything, so she at once brought
her all sorts of things, saying, “Smell this, kiss this ”
And so the little mmd which was forming its own
pattern, recognising umages and fixing them m memory,
fulfillmg an mner labour m joy and tranquillity, was
thrown into confusion Its mytserious labour of nner
order was wiped out by the mncomprehension of an
adult mind
Adults can thus impede this inner Jabour, when they
fall suddenly upon small children without under-
standing what these are about, and dance them up and
down or try to amuse and distract them It 1s the same
sf they take one of the child’s hands and kiss it, as a
game, or if they want to make him sleep without paying
attention to the psychical process at work m him The
adult who 1s unaware of this mysterious labour, may
wipe out the original pattern of the child mind, like
the sea when it sweeps over the sand and carnes away
the sandcastles, so that those who would build on the
sand must begin over and over again. Whereas it 1s
important that the child should be able to preserve the
images he 1s absorbing with a maximum of clarity, for
sts through the clanty and bnilliance of impression
distinguished one from the other, that the ego can build
up the mind
A most interesting experience fell to a distinguished
child-doctor who specialised in the artificial feeding of
children m their first year of fe He had founded a
I Jarge chmic, and hus researches had shown him that
) there 1s an individual factor to be considered even m
* feeding , thus not one of the many milk substitutes can

78
THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE

be recommended as “ good for children” of a given
age, since a food may be good for one child and bad
for another His chmic was the most perfect of the
kind, from both scientific and aesthetic standpoints.
The results on the health of the children were marvell-
ous, up to six months old, but after that period, they
all began to get 1 This was a fnystery, for artificial
feeding becomes easy after the first six months Now
he had, connected with his chmic, a surgery for poor
mothers who could not feed their children, and who:
thus had need of artificial foods, given in accordance
with the advice they obtamed at the chmic. And these
children unlike those in the climec, did not grow ul after
Six months After many experiments the professor
thought that some psychic factor might explain the phe-
Romenon, and at once he was able to note that the
babies of over six months old were suffering from bore~
dom, through want of food for the mind He began
then to amuse. them, to vary their lives, to see that when
they were taken out it was not only on the terrace of

A vast number of experiments have shown with
absolute certainty that during their first year of life
children have acquired their sense impressions of their
environment with such clanity as to recognise them m

tion we notice in the sensitive periods, to showy objects
or bright colours, but rather to tiny things that we
should not notice It 1s as though what now interests
them 1s the mvisible, or that which hes on the very
edge of consciousness

I noticed this sensibility for the first time in a little
girl fifteen months olf I heard her laugh out loud in
the garden, m a way unusual in such small children
She had gone out alone and was sitting on the paving
stones of the terrace Near her was a bed of magni-
ficent gerantums, flowering under an almost tropical
sun But the child was not looking at them , her eyes
were fixed on the ground, where there was nothing to
be seen Here then was another of the emigmas of in-
fancy I crept up and looked where she was looking,
but saw nothing It was she who explained to me, in
words that were hardly words, “There 1s somethng
tuny moving down there ” With this guidance, I was
able to see a tiny, almost invisible insect, the colour of
the stone, moving very quickly What had struck the
child was that such a tiny creature could exist, and could
move, could run Her wonder filled her with noisy
delight, greater than what 1s usual m small children
She was laughing a real laugh, hke a grown-up person
And her joy did not come from sunlight, flowers or
colour

Thad a simular experience with another child of
about the same age Her mother had given her a large
collection of coloured postcards, and the child seemed
anxious to show them to me

“Bam-bam'” she said It was her word for a

an
THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE

motor-car, and I understood that 1t was the picture of a
car she wanted to show me There was an abundance
of pictures , evidently her mother had sought to com-
bine mstruction with pleasure There were pictures of
exotic anumals, giraffes, lions, bears, monkeys, birds and
there were the domestic animals that would certainly
interest a small child—sheep, cats, donkeys, horses,
cows—and there were little landscapes that showed
animals, houses and people But the strange fact was
that in all that nch collection there was no motor-car

“TI don’t see the car,” I said The child hunted
through the pack, and pulled out a card, saying tnum-
phantly, “There!” The picture showed a hunting
scene, but the chief object was a very fine setter Fur-
ther off, in perspective, was the huntsman, with a gun
on his shoulder In a corner, in the distance, was a
tiny cottage, with a wavy lime that was meant to be a
road, and on that line was a black dot The child
pointed to the dot, saying, “Bam-bam ” And, in fact,
in such small proportion that the dot represented a car
Tt was the difficulty of seeing it, the fact that a car
could be made to look so tiny, that made the picture
interesting, and worth showing to me

T thought that perhaps no one had shown the child
the pretty and instructive pictures on the other cards
I chose one, with the head and neck of a giraffe, and
began to explain

“Look, what a funny neck, so long. ”

“ Affa'” (giraffe), said the child gravely 1 had
not the courage to go on

It would seem that there 1s a period during the
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

second year of life in which nature leads the mind
by successive stages to complete apprehension of the
things of its environment I shall give a few examples
drawn from my own experience I once wanted to
show a little boy about twenty months old a fine book,
which was meant for grown-up people It was a copy
of the Gospels, illustrated by Gustave Dore, who had,
here and there, reproduced figures from the Old Mas-
ters, such as Raphael’s Transfiguration I chose the
picture of Jesus calling the children to Him, and began
to explam

“There is a child mght im Jesus’ arms, another lean-
ing his head against Him, and they are all looking at
Him, and He loves them ”

The child’s face did not show the smallest interest,
and, pretending not to notice, I turned over the page
and began to look through the book for another picture.
All at once the child said

“Sleeps ”

‘The words produced in me a disconcerting realisa-
tion of the mystery of the child mmd

“Who sleeps ?”

“Jesus,” answered the child vigorously, “ Jesus.
sleeps, ” and he motioned to me to turn back the pages
The figure of Chnst was placed hugh, so that He was
fooking down on the children, with eyelids lowered, as
over sleeping eyes The child’s attention had been
jra-vn to a detail that no adult have remarked

I went on with my explanation, and stopped at a
aictere taken from Raphael’s Transfiguration, saying,
“Look, how Jesus 1s raised up above the earth, and

82
THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE

how people are frightened Look at the child with its
eyes all twisted, and that woman who 1s stretching out
her arms ” I reahsed that my explanation was not
really suitable for a child, and I had not made a good
choice of pictures But now what interested me was
to evoke another emgmatic response, and almost to
<ompare what an adult sees in so complex a picture
with what would be seen by such a very small child
But this time he only made a kind of grunt, as if to say,
“ Get on, ” and his little face showed no sign of interest
While I was preparing to turn over the page, he
touched a little medallion that he wore round his neck,
and which was shaped hike a rabbit. Then he said,
“Bunny” “He 1s distracted by hus locket,” I thought
But then he showed vigorously that he wanted me to
turn back the page And there, sure enough, in the
picture of the Transfiguration, was a tiny rabbit, to one
side Who has ever noticed it ?

Grown-ups believe that children are sensible only
to very showy things, bnght colours, loud noises, etc
It is true that such violent stimuli attract their atten-
tion ; we have all seen children attracted by people
singing, the sound of bells, flags flying, or brillant lights
But such violent attractions from without are only in-
cidental , they distract the attention, awaken it with
violence, and disperse it over what has stimulated the
senses We, too, though the parallel 1s not exact, if
we are deep in a book and suddenly hear a loud band
beneath the window, get up to go and look. Anyone
who did not percetve that a man sitting silently reading
as intensely concentrated, and who only saw him get up

Q2
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

to listen to the band, would say that men are more
stimulated by sound than by anything else That is
how we have judged children But the fact that a
strong external stimulus attracts thew attention 1s inci-
dental, and comes about by chance It has no rela-
tion to the profound, formative part of the child mind,
which belongs to his mer life We may discern the
manifestations of this inner process when we find
children intent on tmy things, that are scarcely percep-
tible © Whoever observes the smallness of things takes
a great interest im things m themselves, and no longer
feels them as sensory impressions but as the expression
of an “intelligence of love ”

For all practical purposes, the child spirit is a secret
from the adults , 1t appears to them as an enigma, for
they judge of it merely from practical impotence in re-
action and not from the psychical energy that 1s potent
in itself We must reflect that behind every manifesta-
tion there is a decipherable cause There 1s no pheno-
menon that has not its motives, it raison d’etre It 1s
too easy to judge every puzzling reaction, every difficult
phase as naughtimess That naughtness should assume
the importance of a problem that must be solved, an
enigma that must be deciphered ‘This 1s certainly diffi-
cult, but extremely interesting ; it means above all a new
and loftier standpomt on the part of the adult It
makes him a student rather than a blind ruler, or a
tyrannical judge, such as he 1s too often im relation to
the child

A group of women with modern ideas were discuss-
ing just this problem, in a comer of a drawing-room.

84
THE UNFOLDING INTELLIGENCE

Near them, playing quietly by humself, was their hostess’
son, a little boy about a year and a half old The talk
passed from theory to more concrete things, and the
books written for tny children were discussed. “‘ They
are silly books with absurd pictures,” said the young
mother. “I have one with me now called Little Black
Sambo, Sambo isa hittle mgger boy On his birthday
his parents have given him all sorts of things, an um-
brella, a pair of trousers, shoes, stockings and a colour-
ed jacket, and they are preparing a fine dinner for hm
Meanwhile Sambo, who wants to show off his new
clothes, puts them on, and creeps out of the house
And then he meets various wild beasts, who fnghtened
him, and to appease them he must give away his clothes,
piece by piece, so that the giraffe has the umbrella, the
tiger the shoes, and so on, till poor little Sambo goes
home naked and crying But his parents forgive him
and all ends happily in a grand feast, as you see in the
last picture. ”

The book was handed round. And all at once, the
lite boy’s voice was heard, “No, lola ”

‘Everyone was surprised here, maybe, was one of
the emgmas of childhood The child had spoken In-
deed he went on vigorously repeating his mysterious
assertion, “ No, Iola ”

“Lola,” his mother said, “1s the name of a nurse
he had for afew days ” But the child began to scream,
calling “lola” in what seemed a fit of unreasonable
temper Then someone brought the book to him, and
he pointed to the last picture of all—a picture not in
the text, but on the back of the cover, showing a little

85
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD s

nigger in tears At once all understood By “lola”
he was saying, in his baby language, the Spanish word
“llora, which means, “ cries ”

The fact was this , the end of the book was not the
happy banquet, but the picture on the back of the cover
of Little Black Sambo crying No one had noticed
that this picture was there The little boy was making
a logical protest, because lus mother had said, “ It all
ends happily ” For him, it was plain that the book
ended with Sambo crying He had observed the book
more attentively than his mother, and he was accurate
and orginal in deciding that this was the last picture
But what was still more striking was that while he was
barely able to articulate a single word, he could follow
the whole drift of a long conversation

It 1s evident that there are two different personalities
in the child and the adult. It 1s not a case of a mint-
mum growing gradually to a maximum

Children, who see the smallest details of things in
their reality, must look upon us, who project our own
mental syntheses into what we see, as inferior creatures,
incapable people who do not know how to look at
things Perhaps to their judgment we have no sense
of accuracy, and, moreover, pass Over interesting things
with indifference, or unconsciousness Assuredly if
they could express themselves, they would reveal that in
the depths of the mental world they have no confi-
dence in us, just as we have no confidence im the child,
who 1s alien to our mode of conceiving things ‘That 1s.

why the grown-up and the child do not understand each
other

86
CHAPTER IV
WHERE ADULTS IMPEDE
THE QUESTION OF SLEEP

‘THE conflict between the grown-up and the child begins
when the child has reached a pomt where he can do
things on his own.

Earher no one can wholly prevent the child from
seeing and hearing, that 1s, from making a sensory con-
quest of his world. And the grown-up who 1s aware
of the existence of an intense psychic life in the child,
is ready to make the conditions of his environment
more rational, in order to facihtate the process of quiet
absorption at work in the child mind

But when the child grows active, walks, touches
things, 1t 1s quite another thing Grown-ups, however
much they love a child, feel an irresistible instinct to
defend themselves from him —_It 1s an unconscious feel-
ing of fear of disturbance by an unreasoning creature,
combined with a proprietary sense where objects are
concerned that might be dirtied or spoiled

This complex, anxious, defensive attitude conficts
with the love by which the grown-up believes that the
child’s presence gives hum the greatest joy, and that he
himself 1s ready to make every sacrifice, in utter self-
surrender. Now the two psychological states, that of
the grown-up and that of the child, are so different,
that it would be almost impossible for the child and the
grown-up to live together unless necessary adjustments

87
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

were made Here hes the grave problem of how a
child should be treated in the bosom of his family

It 1s easy to see that these adjustments will be to the
complete disadvantage of the child, who 1s im a state of
utter social inferiority The repression of inconvement
acts on the part of the child in the environment where
the adult reigns, becomes imevitable through the fact
that the adult is not conscious of his own defensive att-
tude, and 1s conscious only of love and generous self-
surrender The camouflage of which Freud speaks
comes precisely from such conflicts The sub-con-
scious instinct of defence appears consciously in another
guide, the propmetary sense that makes the adult
anxious to defend things he cherishes from the child
becomes at once, “the duty of trammg the child so as
to teach him good habits,” and fear of the small dis-
turber of his comfort becomes “ the need to make the
child rest a lot for the good of hus health ”

A working-class mother, m her simplicity, defends
herself openly by slaps, scolding and abuse, and by
driving the child out of doors into the street-—m the
intervals of expansive hugs and smacking kisses, which
correspond to the part of her that 1s full of love for her

id

In a higher grade of society, where certain forms of
feeling, such as love, sacrifice, duty, control in outward
acts, are taken for granted, such instincts must be
camouflaged. But upper-class mothers are even readier
than mothers of the people to nd themselves of their
children by confidmg them to a nurse, who will take
them out and make them spend long hours 2n sleep

88
THE QUESTION OF SLEEP

The patience, niceness, and indeed submussiveness
of upper-class mothers to the nurses they employ are
really a tacit understanding that they will forgrve any-
thing, bear anything, so long as the disturbing child is
kept away from his parents and from their possessions

And thus it is that the child has barely emerged from
imprisonment in a helpless body, and is rejoicing in
the trumph of his ego now animating those marvellous
instruments of activity, the organs of voluntary move~-
ment, than he is met by a mighty host of giants who
impede his entry into the world Here is a situation
that reminds us of the exodus of a primitive people,
seeking to free itself from slavery, and advancing
through inhospitable and unexplored lands, like the
Jewish people under the leadership of Moses When
they had at last left bend the wastes of the wilderness
and had found a fertile oasis where they might live at
peace, they found not hospitality but war

Human nature is such that those who possess an
established environment will defend themselves against
invaders ‘This shows itself plainly and violently in the
case of conflicting peoples, but the source of such phe-
nomena hes hidden in the subconscious depths of the
human soul And its first mamfestation, which has
passed unperceived, 1s found when the adult world de-
fends its peace and its possessions against the invading
people of the new generations But the advance of the
invaders 1s not arrested , they fight desperately, for they
are fighting for lfe

Such a conflict, subconscious, camouflaged, takes

89
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

place between the child’s innocence and his parents’
love
* * * * * * *

It 1s very convenient for the grown-up to say “ The
child must not run about, must not touch our things,
must not talk or shout, must spend a lot of time lying
down, must eat and sleep ” Or else to decide that it
“as best” for the child to be sent away from home,
even among persons without affection and unconnected
with the family The adult, by force of mertia, takes
the easiest path, and puts the child to sleep

Who would deny that a child needs sleep? But if
a child ss so alert, so capable of observation, he 1s not
pmmarily a sleeper He will need normal sleep, and
we must certainly see that he gets it. But we must
distinguish between normal sleep and sleep artificially
provoked We know that a strong-willed person can
umpose suggestion on a person of weaker will, and that
the first step in suggestion les m puttmg the patient to
sleep It 1s thus that the adult, albeit unconsciously,
by use of suggestion sends the child to sleep

Uneducated mothers openly give their children sleep~
ing-draughts , peasants will know how to prepare certain
decoctions of poppy heads to make their babies sleep
for long periods But apart from this, we may say
that grown-ups in general, cultured or uncultured, and
even those specialised m the care of children, such as
nurses, agree in condemning these living beings to sleep
when nature would have them wake Not only small
babies a few months old, but bigger children, of two,
or three, or four, are forced to sleep far more than they

90
THE QUESTION OF SLEEP

need. In the latter case, this does not apply to children
of the people They spend all day playing m the
streets, so that they do not worry their mothers, and
are thus spared this danger And it is a well-known
fact that children of the people are less nervous than
those higher in the social scale And yet people insist
on “ long sleeps” as necessary for the health of children,
like eating and fresh air, they are concerned only with
what we may call the vegetative life of the child. I
remember a little boy of seven who confided to me that
he had never seen the stars because he had always been
put to sleep before nightfall, “I should like, ” he told
Me, “just one night to go to the top of a mountain
and he down on the ground to look up at the stars ”
Many parents boast that they have so accustomed their
children to go to sleep early that they themselves are
absolutely free to go out for the evening

The beds prepared for children once they are able
to run about are something quite special They are
not like the cradle, which has a certain beauty of form
and 1s soft, nor like the beds of grown-ups, made sumply
so that they may sleep comfortably A child’s cot is a
cruel pnson prepared for this creature that 1s fighting
for psychic existence In it, the child is a prisoner,
and the iron cage into which he is lowered unwillingly
is at once a reality and a symbol He 1s the prisoner
of a civilisation that has been built up by adults for
the good of adults - and which tends to grow more and
more restrictive and to leave less and less room for the

freedom of the child Around the child there are only
Prisons and emptiness :

‘

91
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

The child’s cot 1s a cage on hugh supports, so that
the grown-up can handle the child without stooping,
and so that he can leave the child alone, sure, that
though he may cry, he cannot hurt himself The room
is darkened so that no light, not even the light of dawn,
may shine to waken bim The child must go to sleep
early in the evening so as to leave his parents free, and
he must sleep late in the morning till they have had
the sleep necessary for grown-ups who have gone to
bed late

One of the first ways of helpmg the psychological
development of the child 1s a reform of his bed and of
the custom of constrammg him to unnaturally long
sleep The child should have the mght to sleep when
he 1s sleepy, to wake when he has slept enough, and to
get up as soon as he likes We therefore advise—and
many families have taken our advice—that the old
child’s cot should be done away with, and that in its
place a very low bed should be made, which the child
can enter or leave when he likes Thuis simple little
reform will solve many difficulties that seemed hard of
soluton A little, low bed, almost on the floor, 1s eco-
nomuical, like all reforms that will assist the child in his
mental life, for the child needs simple things about him,
and instead the few things existing for his sake have
been complicated nm a manner detrimental to hm In
many families this reform has been achieved by puttmg
a little mattress on the floor, on a big, soft carpet, with
the result that children go to bed of themselves, and
say good night gaily, and in the morning get up without
waking anyone There are many examples that go to

show how profound a mistake has been made in the
ordering of a child’s hfe, and how the grown-up,
anxious to do what is good for the child, really goes
counter to his needs, and, unconsciously, 1s moved by a
defensive instinct which could easily be overcome

From all this :t follows that the adult should try
to interpret the child’s needs and meet them as best as
he can by preparing a really suitable environment.
This may be the beginning of a new epoch in educa-
tion, which will consider how it can assist the life of the
child. We must finish with the idea that the child ss
an object to be picked up and carried anywhere when
he is small, and that when he is bigger he must simply
obey and imitate the adult, This idea is an insuper-
able obstacle to any endeavour to make the child’s hfe
more rational The adult must recognise that he must
take second place, endeavour all he can to understand
the child, and to support and help him i the develop-
ment of his hfe This should be the aim of mother and
teacher If the chuld’s personality is to be helped. to
develop, since the child 1s the weaker, the adult with
hus stronger personality must hold himself in check, and,
talang his lead from the child, feel proud if he can
understand and follow him

DELIGHT IN WALKING

It should be the adult’s task to correspond to the
needs of the immature creature in his care, to adapt

himself to 1ts necessities, and to renounce his own man-
her of action,

The higher animals instinctively do something of the
93
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

sort, and adapt themselves to the conditions of their
little ones There 1s nothmg more interesting than
what happens when a baby elephant 1s brought by its
mother into the herd The great mass of huge animals
slows its pace to the pace of the little one and when
the little one 1s tired and stops, all stop

There are also certam forms of civilisation into which
the idea of such sacrifices for the child has entered I
once watched and followed a Japanese father who was
taking his hittle son about a year and and a half old
for a walk All at once the little one clasped lus
father’s leg The father stood still, so that the child
could twist round and round the Jeg he had chosen for
hus game When the child had had enough, the slow
walk went on After a little, the child sat down on
the edge of the pavement, and hus father stood still
beside him ‘The father’s face was grave and natural ,
he was not doing anything out of the ordinary , he was
simply taking lis child for a walk

This 1s how a child should be taken out so that he
may practise the essential act of walking at a time
when his organism requires to establish the variety of
co-ordmated movements that will give hum balance
We must realse the mmense difficulty, reserved for
human beings alone, of walking upright on only two
feet

Though a man’s body is formed of members that
correspond to those of other mammals, he must walk
on two feet stead of four. Even monkeys have long
arms that enable them to rest a hand on the ground
when they walk Man alone must entrust to two lmbs

94
DELIGHT IN WALKING

the whole task of balanced walking, mstead of walking
with support When anunals walk they lft two feet,
diagonally, so that their bodies have always two sup-
ports, but man as he walks rests his weight first on one
foot, then on the other. This difficulty is indeed solved
by nature, but by two means, of which the one is in-
stinct, the other voluntary individual effort

The child does not develop the power to walk up-
night by waiting for it, but by walking The first step,
greeted with such joy by his family, is deed a con-
quest of nature, and marks the passage from his first to-
hus second year It is almost the birth of active man,
in place of inert, helpless man, and for the child a new
hfe begms In physiology, the emergence of this new
function is one of the main tests of normal develop-
ment. But afterwards, it 1s practice that counts, The
achievement of balance and sure footing 1s the result of
long practice, and hence of individual effort. We know
that the child starts walking with an irresistible impetus
and courage He is bold, even rash » he 1s a soldier
who hurls humself to victory regardless of risk And
for this reason the adult surrounds him with protective
restnictions, which are so many obstacles 3 he is en-
closed within a kraal, or strapped in a perambulator, in
which he will make his Outings even when his legs are
already sturdy.

This happens because a child’s step is much shorter
than that of a grown-up, and he has less staying-power
for long walks And the grown-up will not give up his
own pace. Even when the grown-up is a nurse, that
is to say someone who has speciahsed and given herself

95
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

up to a child’s sole care, it 1s the child who must adapt
himself to the ways of the nurse, not the nurse to him
The nurse will go her own pace, pushing the perambu-
lator in which the child sits ke some fine fruit being
driven to market And only when the nurse has reach-
ed the place for which she 1s auming, perhaps a pleas-
ant park, will she sit down, and let the child get out to
play under her watchful eye In all this, only the
child’s body 1s considered, his “ vegetative ” life, which
must be shielded from any possible external danger,
but no account 1s taken of the essential and construc-
tive needs of his mental life

Between the age of a year and a half and two the
chuld can really walk quite a mile, and he can negotiate
difficult places, steep mses or stairs But he walks with
quite a different aim from our own ‘The grown-up
walks to reach an external goal, and he goes straight
towards it. He has, moreover, his own rhythm of walk-
ing, which carries hun forward almost mechanically
The small child walks to develop his powers, he 1s
building up his bemg. He goes slowly He has nei-
ther rhythmic step nor goal. But things around him
allure him and urge him forward IE the adult would
‘be of help, he must renounce his own thythm and his
own aim

In Naples I knew a young family of which the small-
est child was eighteen months old In summer to
reach the sea they had to walk nearly a mile on a
Precipitous road down the hill, which was almost um-
Practicable for any sort of conveyance The young

DELIGHT IN WALKING

him would have been too tmng. The child himself
solved their difficulty by showing he could walk the
whole way Every now and then he would stop to
look at a flower, or sit down on the grass of a meadow,
or stand to watch an ammal Once he stood for about
a quarter of an hour watching a donkey grazing And
so, every day, this baby went down and up the long
difficult road and was not over-tired

In Spain I knew two children between two and three
years old who went for walks of over a mile Other
children would spend over an hour in going up and
down steep stairs with very narrow steps

Speaking of stairs, I am reminded that here again,
is a cause of accusation of “naughtiness” from an-
xious mothers. A lady once asked me about the fits of
temper revealed by her little girl who could just walk.
‘The child screamed whenever she saw a flight of steps,
and when she was hfted to be carried up or down them
she bacame a hittle fury Her mother thought that this
was merely a comcidence, for there seemed no reason
for the child to cry and struggle just because she was
being cared up or down stairs But it was plain that
the little one wanted to go up and down the stairs by
herself. They clearly seemed to her most attractive
places, with so many holds for her hands and all made
up of little seats, far more alluring to walk on than the
fields, where her foot sank in the §rass and her hands
had nothing to which to chng But the fields were the
only places where she was allowed to move about with-

out being held in the arms of a grown-up, or shut in a
perambulator.

HAND AND BRAIN

It 1s interesting to note that the two great Jandmarks
which physiology considers as signs of the normal
development of a child have both to do with movement.
They are the beginning of walking and the beginning
of speech Science, therefore, has considered these
two motor functions as a kind of horoscope in which to
read the future of the man For indeed these two com-
plex manifestations show that the man-to-be has won
the first victory of his ego over his mstruments of ex-
Pression and activity Now language 1s specifically
chracteristic of man, for it expresses thought, while
Walking is an action common to the ammals An ani-

98
HAND AND BRAIN

mal differs from a vegetable in that it can move about
of itself, and when this movement 1s entrusted to special
lumbs, waikmng becomes a basic characterisic But m
man, though his power of moving his body im space 1s
sO great as to have led to his mvasion of the whole
earth, walking 1s not his specifically characteristic move-
ment as an intelligent bemg

Instead, the true “ motor characteristic” connected
with mind is the movement of the hand in the service
of the mind m working out an idea We know that
the first traces of man in prehistoric eras are deduced
from the presence of the chipped stones that were his
first tools This then is the characteristic that cuts a
new furrow in the biological story of hving creatures
Language itself appears as a document of man’s past
when it, a sound that is lost in air, has become some-
thing man’s hand has engraven on stone The mor-
phology of the body and the achievement of walking
are characterised by this liberation of the hand, the de-
dication of the upper limbs to other functions than those
of mere movement, so that they become the executive
Organs of the mind It is thus that m the evolution
of living beings man takes Up a new position, revealing
by his movements the functional unity of his psyche,

The hand is the deheate and structurally complicat-
ed organ that allows the mind not Only to manifest itself
but to enter into special relations with its environment.
Man, we may say, takes Possession of his environment
by his hand, and transforms it as his mind directs, thus
fulfilling his mission on the great stage of the universe

It is therefore logical, when we wish to judge of the

99
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

psychological development of a child, to consider the
first begmnings of what we may call the two forms of
mund-inspired movement, the appearance of speech and
the appearance of activity im the hand, as aspimng to
work,

By subconscious instinct man has always associated
these two motor manifestations of the mind, peculiar to
the human race, and has recognised their significance,
but only in certain symbols connected with the social
life of the adult, For mstance, when a man and woman
marry they utter certain words and jom ther hand
To consent to marry 1s to “ say the word”, to ask a
woman In marriage 1s to “ ask her hand ” In an oath
a word 1s spoken and a gesture is made In any nitual
into which expression of the ego enters strongly, the
hand plays its part Pilate, to show his repudiation of
all responsibility, declares mn the mtual phrase that he
washes his hands, and at the same tme actually washes
his hands before the croud. The Catholic priest
during Mass, before entering upon the most intimate
part of the sacred function, announces that he will wash
his hands, “ I will wash my hands among the innocent, ”
and washes them mm a httle basin, though his hands
were not only washed but purified before he went up
to the altar

All this shows how in the subconsciousness of huma-
nity the hand 1s felt to express the inner “I” Can
we conceive of anything more sacred or more wonder-
ful than the development of this essentially human
movement im the child? Nothing should awaken more
solemn expectancy The first stretching out of those

100
HAND AND BRAIN

tuny hands towards things, the impetus of a movement
that represents the effort of the ego to penetrate the
world, should fill the adult observer with wonder and
reverence And instead man is afraid of those tiny
hands as they stretch out to the valueless and insigni-
ficant objects within their reach , he sets out to defend
these objects against the child He 1s constantly re-
peating “ Don’t touch!” just as he repeats, “ Sit still !
Be quiet!” And mm this anxiety, in the shadowy deeps
of his subconsciousness, he organises a defence, calling
on the assistance of other men, as though they must
secretly fight against a power that threatens their com-
fort and their goods

Everyone realises that before a baby can see or hear,
that 1s, garner from its environment the elements neces-
sary to build up its first mental fabric, these elements
must exist. Now when the child has to move in a
constructive manner, using his hands at some work,
he needs to have outward things that he can handle,
that 1s, it 1s necessary for him that “ motives of acti-
vity” should exist in his environment But in his home
this need has not been considered The things that
surround him all belong to grown-ups, and are made
for ther use They are forbidden to the child—
tabooed The command “Don’t touch!” is the only
answer to this vital problem of infant development If
the child touches such forbidden objects, he 1s punish-
ed or scolded If he succeeds in taking hold of some-
thing, he is hke a hungry little puppy who carries off
a bone to gnaw it ina comer, trying, insufficient as it 1s,
to find nourishment in it, before he is chased away.

101
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

Now the child’s movements are not due to chance
He 1s building up the necessary co-ordimations for orga-
mised movements directed by his ego, which commands
from withm The ego, organising and co-ordinating,
1s bringing his mner psyche and his organs of expres-
sion into umty by means of continual integrative expe-
miences It is therefore mmportant that the child himself,
acting spontaneously, should choose and execute his
acts Such formative movement has special features ,
itis not the result of disordered or chance unpulses It
4s not Just runming, or jumping, or handling things aum-
lessly, or smply displacmg them so as to create dis-
order, or destroy them Constructive movement finds
its urge i actions that the child has seen performed by
others The actions he tries to umitate are always those
that mean the handling or the use of something, with
which the child tries to perform the actions he has seen
performed by adults Therefore these activities are
associated with the usages of his various domestic or
social surroundings The child will want to sweep and
wash up, or wash clothes, pour out water, or wash and
dress himself, brush his own hair Since this 1s a uni-
versal fact, it has been called imitation the child does
what he has seen done But there is a difference be-
tween what he does and the direct imitation we asso-
ciate with a monkey The child’s constructive move-
ments start from a psychical Structure, built up on an
apprehension His psychical life, which must govern
his movements, 1s always pre-existent to the movements
associated with it When the child wants to do some-
thmg, he knows beforehand what 1t is » be wants to do

something that he knows, that 1s, that he has seen done
We may say the same about the development of speech
The baby absorbs the speech it hears spoken around it,
and when it says a word it says 1t because it has learned
it by heanng it, and holds it present in the memory
It uses 1t according to its need of the moment This
knowledge and use of a word it bas heard 1s not umita-
tion in the sense that a parrot’s talk is imitation It 1s
a case not so much of immediate umitation as of some-
thmg that has been observed and stored up, of know-
ledge that has been acquired Its reproduction as
speech 1s a distinct act This distinction 1s very im-
portant because on the one hand it throws light on the
telations between an adult and a child, and on the other
it allows us a more intumate comprehension of child
activities

PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY

Before the child can perform actions with a clearly
logical motive, such as those he has seen performed by
grown-ups, he begins to act for purposes of his own,
using things for ends that are often unintelligible to
adults This often happens with children between a
year and a half and three. Once, for example, I saw
a child of a year and a half who found a pile of nap-
kuns that had just been ironed and were neatly laid one
On the top of the other The child took one of these
folded napkins, holding it with the greatest care and
putting one hand under it so that it should not unfold,
and carried it diagonally across the room to the oppo-
site corner, where he put it on the ground saying “Onc!”

103
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

He then went back, taking the same diagonal path—a
sign that he was guided by some special directional sen-
sibiity He took a second napkin mm the same way,
cared st along the same path, and put it down on the
top of the first, saymg agam “One” This he did til
he had carried over the whole pile Then, m exactly
the same fashion, he took them all back to their onginal
place Although the pile of napkins was no longer m
the perfect state im which the maid had left it, all the
napkins were still fairly well folded, and though the
tower they made showed certam deficiencies, it could
not be considered dismantled Luckily for the child
no one of the family had been present during the leng-
thy manoeuvre How often do small children see a
grown-up descending on them with a cry of “Stop! Put
that down!” And how many times are those tiny, so
much to be venerated hands, slapped so that they shall
Jearn not to touch things '

Another “elementary” occupation that fascinates
children 1s to take stoppers m and out of bottles, espe-
crally if the stopper 1s one of prismatic glass, reflecting
the colours of the rainbow, lke that of a scent bottle
‘This unstoppermg and restoppenng of bottles seems one
of thew favourite elementary plays , another is to raise
and lower the top of a big inkstand or the lid of a
massive box, or to open and shut the door of a cup-
board And it goes without saying that there will often
be war between the grown-up and the child over these
too alluring objects which are so eminently tabooed
because they belong to mamma’s dressing-table or
daddy’s writing-desk, or the drawing room furniture

104
PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY

And often the result 1s “naughtiness” But the child
does not want just that particular bottle, or that ink-
stand , he would be satisfied with things made for hun,
allowmg him to practise the same movements

These and similar actions are primary actions that
have no logical purpose, and which can be considered
as the first stammermng steps of man as worker, It is
this preparatory period that we have envisaged in some
of our apparatus for the use of very small children, such
as our solid msets, which have had such universal
success

The idea of leaving the baby free to act 1s one that
1s easily understood, but which im practice encounters
complicated obstacles, deeply rooted in the adult mind
Often a grown-up who will wish to leave the child
free to touch and move things will be unable to resist
vague impulses which end by mastering lim A young
mother in New York had assented to these ideas, and
wished to put them into practice with her fine little
son who was two and a half years old. One day she
saw him carrying a jug full of water from the bedroom
into the drawing-room, for no reason She saw how
tense he was, the effort he was making at every step,
while all the time he kept repeating to himself, “Be
careful, be careful!” The jug was heavy, and a
moment came when lus mother could not resist helping
him, so that she took the jug from him and carried it to
the place he wished The lnttle boy remained tearful
and humiliated, and his mother was grieved to think she
had caused him pain She justified herself by saying
that though she knew that he was driven by some ner

105
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

necessity, she felt she could not let him tire himself out
and spend so much tune on something she could do for
dum m a moment

“T know I did wrong,” she told me, asking my
advice almost as though she were a sick person asking
a doctor how she could be cured

I pondered on the other side of the question, the
instinct to defend things agamst the child, that feeling
almost of avarice where the child 1s concerned I asked
her, “ Have you any rare china, some cups for instance,
that are really valuable? Then let him carry one of
those light ttle cups, and see what happens?” She
followed my advice and told me afterwards that her
litle son carned the cups with care and attention, stop-
ping at every step, till he had brought them safely to
thew destmation The mother was torn between two
feelings, her joy un seemg the child at work and her
anxiety for the cups The two feelings counterbalanc-
ed each other so that she could make herself allow the
child to perform the task that so passionately attracted
hum and which seemed necessary to his psychic health

On another occasion I gave a little girl of a year
and a half a duster which was a source of delight as she
sat down and dusted various shinng things But mn
her mother there was a kind of inhibition that did not
allow her to give a small child some thmg so seemingly
futile and so far removed from the hygienic principles
she had learned

The first manifestations of the mstinct to work are
profoundly disturbing to any adult who has realised
their umportance He sees that he must make an um-

106
PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY

mense renunciation , it 1s as though he must mortify
his personality, surrender his environment, and this 1s
incompatible with social hfe as it exists In an aduit
environment the child 1s undoubtedly an extra-social
beg. But sumply to shut him out, as has been done
up till now, means a repression of his growth, as though
he were condemned to become dumb

The solution of this conflict les m preparing an
environment adapted to these ngher mamfestations on
the part of the child When he says his first word there
is no need to prepare anything and Ins baby language
3s heard in the house as a welcome sound But the
work of his small hands demands “ motives of activity ”
im the form of suitable objects © We shall then see
small children performing actions that demand an im-
pressive effort, sometimes beyond what we should con-
sider physically possible I have here the photograph
of a little English girl who 1s carrying a huge cottage
loaf, so big that her arms cannot support the weight
and she must rest it on her body. She has therefore
to walk bending back so far that she cannot see where
to put her feet. In the photograph we see only the
anxiety of her dog who will not let her out of his sight ,
he 1s all tense, as though about to bound to her help
But further off there were grown-up people, who had to
make a great effort to keep themselves from running
to take the loaf out of her arms

Sometimes very tiny children show a precocious skill
and accuracy of movement that Must arouse our won-
der. Ifan environment 1s prepared for them, they will
take on complex social functions in their child world.

107
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

I remember the deep impression made on me by a
little boy of two who with great gravity waited on other
children of the same age, preparing the table for them
and domg the honours of the house In these lofty
labours he was plamly struck by two lighted candles
which his mother had set on hus birthday cake, for,
confusing the significance of things, he went about tell-
ing people “I have two years and two candles” *
* * * * * * *

The adult who has not grasped that manual activity
1s a vital need for the child, and who does not recog-
muse the first manifestation of an mstinct to work,
prevents the child from working Thuis 1s not always
the result of a defensive attitude, but may have other
causes One 1s that an adult looks at the outward
purpose of an action, and has his own fixed mode of
acting which 1s part of his mental make-up To try to
teach his ends by the most direct method, hence m the
shortest possible time, has become for lum a kind of
natural Jaw, which he has indeed formulated as “ the
Jaw of least effort”  Seemg the child make great efforts
to perform a totally useless action, or one so futile that
he himself could perform it m an imstant and far better,
he 1s tempted to help, as though to put an end to a
disturbing spectacle The enthusiasm he sees in a small
child over such trivial things imtates him as something
absurd and incomprehensible If a child notices that
a tablecloth is set askew on a table and remembers how
it 1s usually spread, he will try to put it mght 10 exactly

*“T have two years ”—Iteral translation of the Italian and
French idiom for “I am two ”

108
PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY

the way he remembers, and, if he can do so, he does it
slowly but with all the energy and enthusiasm of which
he 1s capable For to remember 1s lus mind’s chief
task, and to put something to mghts as he has seen it, is
the supreme tnumph corresponding to his stage of
development. But he is only able to do this when no
grown-up 1s by to notice his effort

If a child tries to brush his own hair the grown-up,
instead of feeling overjoyed at this marvellous attempt,
feels an assault on the very laws of his bemg He sees
that the child cannot brush his hair well, nor quickly,
and will not attain the desired end, while he, the adult,
can do it so quickly and so much better Whereupon
the child, who 1s delightedly performing one of those
actions that build up his personality, sees the grown-up,
a great big figure nearly as tall as the ceiling, immeasur-
ably strong, and against whom there can be no resist-
ance, coming up to him and taking the brush away,
saying that he will do the brushing A grown-up does
the same if he sees a small child painfully trying to dress
himself, or to do up his shoes Every attempt made by
the child ts interrupted The adult is imtated not only
by the fact that the child 1s trying to perform an action
when there 1s no need, but also by his different rhythm,
his different manner of moving Rhythm 1s not hke
an old idea that can be changed, or a new idea that
can be understood Each individual has a rhythm in
lis movements that 1s part of him, an intrinsic charac-
tenstic, almost lke the shape of his body, and if this
thythm is in harmony with other simular thythms, it
cannot be adapted to different thythms without dis-

109
‘THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD’

comfort If, for example, we are near a paralytic and
must walk by hus side, we feel an tense discomfort,
and if we see a paralytic slowly raising a glass to his
lps, at the risk of spillmg its contents, the msufferable
clash of different rhythms brings a discomfort from
which we seek to free ourselves by substituting our own
thythm for that of the other , and this we call helping
lum = The adult with the child does something of the
same land As if in unconscious defence he tnes to
prevent the child from making those slow clumsy move-
ments, just as he would uresistibly brush away a harm-
less fly that annoyed him

Contranwise, the adult can endure the child’s move-
ments when they are swift, m a quicker rhythm, m
this case he 1s ready to put up with the disorder and
disturbance introduced into his environment by the
child Here the adult can “arm himself with patience,”
for here 1s something clear and manifest, and the adult’s
will can always control his conscious acts But when
there is a slowness m the child’s movements, the adult
3s irresistibly impelled to substitution Thus mstead
of helping the child in his most essential psychic needs,
the adult substitutes himself for the child m all the acts
the child wants to perform by himself, thus closing
every path of activity to him and becoming the might-
est impediment to his vital evolution The despairmg
shnieks of the “ naughty” child who does not want to
be washed, or dressed, or have his hair brushed, are
scenes in the earliest drama of human struggle

Who would ever have thought that the useless assist-
ance given to the child 1s the first root of all repressions

110
ADULT SUGGESTION

and hence of the most penlous injury the adult indivi
dual can do to the child ? ;

The Japanese mind has attamed an impressive con~
ception of the children’s hell. As part of their cult
of the dead they lay in the tombs of children a quantity
of little stones or stone-like objects, to help them to
save themselves from the torments that the demons of
the other world will continually try to inflict on them
When the child 1s building something, a demon will
knock it down and destroy it And then the little
stones provided by the pious care of his parents will
enable him to rebuild it. Here 1s one of the most im~-

pressive projections of the subconscious into another
life

ADULT SUGGESTION

The adult’s substitution of bis own action for that
of the child does not only take the form of actng
instead of him, but may show itself as an infiltration
of the adult will into that of the child, so that it substi-
tutes itself for the child’s own will Then it is no
longer the child who acts, but. the adult who acts
through him

When Charcot in his famous Institute of Psychiatry
demonstrated the substitution of personality achieved
by means of suggestion in the case of hysterical subjects,
he made a sensanon His expermments undermmed
Tundamental conceptions believed unshakable, namely
that ‘man is the master of hus own actions It was
possible to prove expermentally that a suggestion could
be imposed on a subject to such a point as to suppress

Wy
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

his personality and substitute for it that of the hypno-
tst, These facts, though confined to the clinic and to
a very restricted number of experiments, none the less
opened a new field of research and discovery Such
phenomena led to studies on double personality, on
subconscious and sublimmal psychological states, and
finally to exploration of the realm of the unconscious
by psycho-analysis

There 1s a period of life extraordinarily open to sug-
gestion—the period of fancy when consciousness 1s 10
Process of formation and sensibility towards external
factors 1s m a creative state The adult can then msi-
nuate his own personality, as though by subtle infiltra~
tion, into the child, so as to anumate by his own will
that sublime quality of the child’s will, its fluidity

We noticed in our schools that of in showing a child
how to do anythmg we did so with too much enthu-
stasm, or performed the movements with too much
energy or excessive accuracy, we quenched the child’s
capacity of judging and acting according to his own
personality The result 1s, as it were, a movement
detached from the ego that should command it, and
taken from another extraneous and stronger ego which,
by a shght motion, has the tremendous power of seiz-
ing, almost of stealing the child’s personality from its
own tender organs _It 1s not only wilfully that the adult
exercises suggestion, but even without willing it or
knowing it, and without having realised the existence of
the problem

I shall give a few examples One day I myself saw
a child of about two who had put a pair of shoes on a

112
ADULT SUGGESTION

white bed-cover With an unreflecting movement, im-
pulsive, not measured, I took the shoes and put them
on the ground m a corner saying “ That’s dirty !” and
with my hand I brushed the cover where the shoes had
Jain After this the child, whenever he saw a pair of
shoes, ran to pick them up and put them in another
Place, saying “ Dirty!” after which he would pass his
hand over a bed as if to brush it, though the shoes had
never been near it.

Another example A famuly receives a parcel, which
the mother greets with expressions of delight She
opens it and finds a handkerchief, which she imme-
diately hands to her little gurl, then a mouth-organ,
which she puts to her hips to play , then she cries joy-
fully to the child, “Music!” For some time the
little girl, whenever she received a handkerchief, grew
rather excited and said “ Music!”

Inhibiting factors are especially able to be infil-
trated by an extrancous will into the acts of a child,
when the will of the adult does not act sufficiently
violently to provoke a reaction This comes to pass
particularly among well-behaved, self-controlled people,
and especially through refined nurses A most illu-
minating case I encountered was that of a child of
about four who was alone with her grandmother in
her own home The little girl showed a wish to turn
on the tap of a fountain to see the gush of water, but
just as she was about to do it, she drew back her
hand Her grandmother encouraged her to turn on

the tap, but the child answered, “No, Nurse doesn’t
allow it.”

113
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

The grandmother tned to persuade her that she
herself gave her full consent, pointing out to her that
she was in her own home The little girl smiled with
pleasure, showmg her contentment and above all her
eagemess to see the fountain, but, though she stretch-
ed out her arm to the tap, at the last moment her hand
drew back without tummng it The sense of obedience
to an order from the absent nurse was so potent that
the affectionate persuasion of someone near at hand
could not out-weigh that distant force

A similar case was that of a bigger child, of about
seven, who, when he was sittmg down and wanted to
get up and run to something in the distance that at-
tracted hum, had to come back and sit down, as though
by an oscillation in his will which he could not over-
come No one knew who was the “master” who
commanded within him, for of this the child’s memory
had lost all trace

We may say that the openness of cluldren to sug-
gestion is an exaggeration of one of their constructive
Psychological functions, namely of a characteristic
anner sensibility that we have called “love of the en-
vironment.” The child observes things eagerly and
1s attracted by them, but above all he 1s attracted by
the actions of the grown-up, and seeks to know and
to reproduce them Now in this the grown-up may
have a kind of mission that of inspiring the childish
actions, of being an open book in which the child
may read guidance for his own movements and learn
what he should learn m order to act properly But
af this 1s to be the case, the adult must be always calm

114
ADULT SUGGESTION

and act slowly so that all the details of his action may
be clear to the child who 1s watching If the adult
abandons himself to his usual quick, powerful rhythms,
then instead of inspirmg he may engrave his own per-
sonality on the child’s, and substitute himself for the
child by suggestion

Even imammate objects if they are attractive to the
senses can have a power of suggestion in that they
may force themselves upon the child’s notice, like
Magnets attracting from without To make this clear
I will quote an interesting experiment made by Pro-
fessor Levine and which he illustrates by his psycho-
logical films. He wished to note the different beha-
viour of defective and normal children in our schools
(taking care to choose children of about the same age
and environment) when confronted by the same
objects

In this film we see a jong table prepared, with on
it a number of different objects, including some of
our apparatus A group of children comes m They
are at once attracted, interested by the objects before
them They are hvely and full of smiles, and look
pleased to find themselves among so many things.
Each takes up something and sets to work, then puts
it down and chooses another and so on, making one
experiment after another. That 1s one picture

Here ts another A second group of children comes
in They move slowly, stop, look round. They make
for one of the many objects and stand round it for some

time, and then they scem to stand still, mactive That
is the second picture

115
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

Which of these two groups of children is that of
» defectives and which that of the normal ones?
ie defectives are the lively, happy children, who
yve quickly, pass from one thing to another, and
mt to try everything To the public it 1s they who
2m the intelligent ones, for everyone 1s used to think-
3 that hvely, gay children who flit from one thing
another are intelligent
And instead the normal children are those that are
2n moving calmly, spendmg much time m stand-
g stl and then fixing upon one thing as though in
fection Hence calm, restramed and measured
ovement, and a thoughtful disposition are the attr-
ites of normahty
The experiment reproduced by the two pictures
ems to conflict with generally established ideas, for
an ordinary environment intelligent children act
xe the defective children of the film ‘The normal
uld, slow, reflective, 1s a new type, but he shows at
ice that his controlled movements are ruled by his
so and governed by reason Such children master
e suggestion that comes to them from outward things
ad deal with such things in freedom The amport-
at thing is thus not a great deal of movement but self-
‘astery The important thmg for any dividual 1s
ot that he should move anyhow and m any sense,
at that he should have gamed the mastery of his
otor organs The ability to move as directed by his
wn ego and not as dommated by the pure attraction
£ outward things, leads a child to concentrate on one
ung only, and this 1s a phenomenon of mner origin

116
THE IMPORTANCE OF MOVEMENT

Such delicate and sensitive movement 1s the truly
normal state , it sums up an order that we may call
an order of mner discipline Dusciphne in outward
acts 1s the expression of an mmner discipline that has
crystallised round order When this does not happen,
movement passes out of the control of the personality
and may be dommated by an extraneous will, and it
will remain at the mercy of external objects, lke a
ship without rudder. It is difficult for an extraneous
will to produce disciplined activity because the organi-
sation for such activity is wanting And then we may
say that the individuality is broken up ‘The child
who has lost the opportunity of developing according
to his own nature could almost be compared to a man
who has landed from a balloon in a desert, and who
all at once sees his balloon carried away by the wind
He will not be able to do anything to guide it and he
sees nothing near him that will take its place That
18 a picture of man as he really develops through the
struggle between the adult and the child His is a
darkened nund, undeveloped and remote from his

means of expression, which are as though left to the
mercy of the elements

THE IMPORTANCE OF MOVEMENT

Tt 3s very clear that since the adult has had no
notion of how important actwity is to the child, he
has simply prevented such disturbing activity.

It 1s not equally clear how scientists and teachers
have failed to note the supreme importance of activity
in the building up of the man-to-be The very word

117
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

“anmal” imphes the idea of animation, that 1s, of
activity , the difference between ammals and vegeta-
bles 1s that vegetables stand still and ammals move
How then could it ever have been thought desirable
to subdue the activities of a child ?

Various expressions of praise show a subconscious
acceptance of such an attitude The child 1s called a
“ttle flower "something that keeps still. Or else,
“a little angel, ” that 1s, a being that moves nay, flies,
but im another world from the world of men

All this reveals the mysterious blindness of the
human soul extending far beyond the narrow lmuts
assigned by Freud to psychological scotoma, which he
describes as a partial blindness existing m the uncon-
scious of humanity

This blindness is deep mdeed if science, with its
systematic methods for discovering the unknown, has
passed by the most formidable testimony of human
life without revealing it

All have agreed on the importance of the senses sn
building up the mid No one doubts that the md
of a deaf mute, or of a blind child, encounters extra-
ordinary difficulhes im its development, for sight and
heanng are the gates of the mind , they are known as
the intellectual senses It 1s also agreed, mmtrmsic con-
ditions being equal, that the intelligence of deaf mutes
and of the blind remams inferior to that of men who
enjoy the use of all their senses Yet the sufferings
of the blind and deaf are plam to all, though they are
other than physical sufferings, and even compatible
with perfect health No one would be so absurd as

118
THE IMPORTANCE OF MOVEMENT

to suppose that by artificially depnving children of
sight and hearmg they would be made better able to
assimuate intellectual culture and social morality
Nor could anyone ever think that for the progress of
civilisation we must look to the deaf and blind.

But it would be hard to gain acceptance for the
idea that movement has as much and more importance
for the moral and intellectual building up of men
Man if he builds himself, neglecting his organs of
movement, will have an arrested development, and
Temam permanently m a graver state of inferionty
than that which anses from the absence of one of the
intellectual senses

The sufferings of the man who remains the prisoner
of lus flesh present a more tragic and significant pic-
ture than the suffermgs of those deaf or bind. The
blind and the deaf lack only the elements in their en-
vuconment that act as external means to their develop-
ment, The soul has such powers of adaptation that
up to a certain point the keenness of one sense may
supply the deficiency of another But movement is a
part of man’s very personality, and nothing can take
uts place The man who does not move is injured in
his very being and 1s an outcast from life.

* * * *

When people speak of muscles they have at once
the idea of a mechanism, indeed of the mechanism of
a machine And this seems very far removed from

the idea we have formed of the spint, which 1s remote
from matter and mechanisms

119
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

To attribute to movement even greater importance
than to the so-called intellectual senses in the deve-~
lopment of mind and in the intellectual evolution of a
man, seems a defiance of accepted ideas.

But m the eye and ear there are mechanisms
Nothing could be more perfect than the sublime, hving
camera we find in the eye And the ear is an assem-
bly of many-stringed harps with a jazz-band complete
even to the drum !

When, however, we speak of the importance of
these sublime imstruments im building up the intell-
gence, we do not think of them as mechanisms, but we.
think of the ego that uses them Through these mar-
vellous vital mstruments the ego comes into relation
with the world and uses them according to its psycho-
logical needs The sight of the beauties of nature, of
sunrise or sunset, or of works of art, the sonorous m-
pressions of the outer world, man’s voice, or music,
all these mamifold and continuous impressions give the
ammer ego the delights of psychic hfe and the nourtsh-
ment necessary for its conservation

The ego is the real agent, the smgle arbiter, and
the recipient of the sense impressions If there were
no ego to see and enjoy, what would be the use of the
mechanisms of the sensory organs? It is not the fact
of seemg or hearmg that 1s important, but the fact
that the ego should form itself, grow, enjoy and mam-
tain itself, through seeing and hearing

Now we can draw an analogy between this, and
movement Movement, without any doubt, has its
mechanical organs, though these are not ngid and

fixed ke the membrane of the tympanum or the
crystal Jens of the eye Now the fundamental problem
of human hfe and hence of education 1s that the ego
should be able to animate and master its own instru-
ments of motion, 1n order that 1m its actions it should
be guided by something higher than material objects
or the functions of vegetative life, something which 1s
generally mstinct, but which in man 1s openly a crea-
uve spint, clothed with intelligence.

If the ego cannot attam this essential condition
its unity will be shattered It will be as though an

imstinct were to go about the world separated from
the body it should ammate

“ INTELLIGENCE OF LOVE ”

The whole labour of life, which fulfils itself subject
to its laws and brings beings mto harmony, reaches
consciousness under the form of LOVE.

It 1s not the motor impulse, but it is a reflection
of the motor impulse, as planets reflect the ght of
the sun The motor 1s instinct, the creative urge of
life But this, m bringing creation to being, tends to
make love felt, and therefore love fills the conscious-
ness of the child His self-realisation comes about
in him through love.

Indeed it 1s as love of his environment that we
may envisage the irresistible urge, which, throughout
the sensitive periods, unites the child to things = It 3s
not love in the sense that 1s commonly understood,
as an emouonal feeling, but a love of the intelligence
which sees and assimilates and builds itself through

121
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

lovmg Yes, the inner guide that leads children to
observe what 1s about them could be descnbed in
Dante’s phrase, as “ mtelligence of love ”

It 1s indeed a form of love that gives them the
faculty of observing in such an intense and meticulous
manner the thmgs in their environment that we, grown
cold, pass by unseemg Is it not a characteristic of
love, that sensibility that enables a child to see what
others do not see? That collects details that others
do not perceive, and appreciates special qualities, which
are, as 1t were, hidden, and which only love can dis-
cover? It 1s because the child’s intelligence assumi-
Jates by loving, and not just indifferently, that he can
see the mvisible This active, ardent, meticulous,
constant absorption in love 1s characteristic of children

To the adult it appears as liveliness and joy, as
intensity of life , these are recognised as infant charac-
tenstics But there has been no recogmtion of the
love behind them, that 1s to say, the spimtual energy,
the moral beauty that accompanies creation

The child’s love is still pure of contrasts He
loves because he takes, because nature orders him
to do so And what he takes he absorbs to make it
a part of his own hfe, so as to create his own beng

In the child’s environment the adult is a special
object of love From him the child receives material
things and help, and from hum the child takes, with
intense love, what is necessary for his self-making
The adult 1s the venerable being from whose lips, as
from a spintual fountain, the words issue that will
enable the child to build his own-speech, and which

122
“INTELLIGENCE OF LOVE”

will serve him asa guide, For the child the words of
a grown-up are supernatural stimuli, bringing an um-
pression of projectiles of the spmit It is he, the
grown-up, who by hus actions shows the child, who
has come from nothing, how men move To imitate
him 1s to enter into life The child is enveloped and
fascinated by his words, which assume the force of
suggestion ; hence the child is sensitive to the grown-
up to such a degree that his own personality may
vanish and the grown-up hve and work in him instead
The incident of the child who had put the dirty shoes
on the bed-cover shows an obedience carried to the
point of suggestion What the grown-up tells him
remams engraved in his mind, luke words incised by a
chisel on stone. The word “ music ,” uttered by the
mother who had received the parcel, 1s another in-
stance Therefore the adult should count and measure
all bis words before the child, for the child is hungry
to take from him, he 1s an accumulator for love

The child is disposed to obey the adult, in the very
roots of his spint Only when the adult asks him to
deny the commands of the inner impulse urging him
to creation by unalterable rules and laws, does it be-
come impossible for the child to obey It 1s then
as if someone were to tell hum, when he 1s teething,
to stop and to let no more teeth appear. The naught-
nesses and disobediences of the child are the expres-
sion of a vital conflict between his creative urge and
his love for the grown-up who does not understand
him. When instead of obedience the grown-up en-
counters temper, he should always attribute it to this

192
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

conflict, and to the defence of a vital act necessary to
the child’s growth -

We must indeed realise that the child wants to obey
us and loves us The child loves the grown-up beyond
anything, but people speak only of the grown-up’s
love for the child This 1s said not only of parents
but of teachers, “‘ Teachers love children!” It 1s said
also that the child must be taught to love, to love his
mother, his father, his teacher, to love all men, to love
ammals, flowers, everything

Who then will teach bom? Who will be his master
m the art of love? Those who put down all his
symptoms to naughtiness and who think of defending
themselves and their possessions agaist him? It 1s
clear that such cannot teach him to love, for they
have no longer the sensitivity that we have called
“intelligence of love ”

It ss, on the contrary, the child who loves the
adult, who wants him near, to be always with him,
and whose delight lies in calling his attention to him-
self, “ Look at me, stay with me ”

When the child goes to bed in the evening he calls
the loved person and begs hum not to go away When
we go in to dinner the tiny child that still feeds at
ius mother’s breast would hke to come with us, to
stay near to watch us, not to eat. The adult passes
by this mystical love without perceiving it. But the
little one who so loves us will grow up, will vanish
And who will ever love us as he does? Who else
will ever summon us on going to bed, saying “Stay
with me, as long as I hve?” When the child is

124
“ INTELLIGENCE OF LOVE ”

grown, he will say an mdifferent “Good mght, Good-
bye ” Who then will be eager just to watch us while
we eat, though he eats nothing? We defend our-
selves against this love that will pass away, and we
shall never find anything to equal it We in our tur-
moil say, “I haven’t time, I can’t, I have a lot to do, ”
and we think im our hearts, “The child must be taught
better, or he will make us his slaves * What we want
is fo be free from him to do what we ourselves like
domg, so as not to give up our convenience

It ts terrible naughtiness in the child if he goes to
wake up hus father and mother of a morning, when
they are still asleep Nurse, where social conditions
allow, must prevent this more than anything Nurse
is the guardian of the parents’ morning sleep

And yet, what is 1t but love that urges the child
to go to his parents as soon as he wakes? And where
he can, he gets out of bed early, like every other pure
creature, when the sun appears The child goes to
find his parents who are still asleep, as if to say, “ learn
to live holily , it 1s hght, its mormng ” But he does
Not go to them as a teacher, he only runs to see those
he loves Perhaps the rooms are stu dark, curtamed
so that the mornmg light shall not disturb the sleep-
ers Perhaps the child goes stumbling, his heart beat-
ing for fear of the darkness, but he overcomes every-
thing, he comes softly and touches them His father
and mother scold him: “Didn't I tell you not to
wake me up in the morning ?”

“But I didn’t wake you,” says the child “I only
touched you, I only wanted to give you a kiss ”

125
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

It is as though he said, “I didn’t want to wake you
physically, I only wanted to waken your spint ”

Indeed the child’s love has a great significance
where we are concerned His father and mother sleep
all their lives, they have a tendency to sleep over every-
thing, and it 1s necessary that a new creature should
str them and sustam them with a fresh and hving
energy that they have Jong lost. It 1s necessary that
a creature who lives differently should come to tell
them every mormmg, “‘ There 1s another life, that you
have forgotten Leam to lve better ”

To live better To feel the touch of love

Man would degenerate without the child to help
hum to mse If the adult does not waken little by
little, a hard crust will form round him, and render
hum insensible This makes us think of the words of
the Last Judgment, when Christ will say to the lost,
to those who have not made use of the means of mm-
provement they have encountered m life “ Depart
from me, you cursed I was a stranger and you
took me not in, naked and you covered me not, sick
and in prison and you did not visit me ”

The answer “Lord, when did we see thee hun-
Sry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or m
prison and did not mimuster to thee?”

“Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to
one of these least, neither did you do it to me ”

In the vivid description of the Gospel, it would
seem that we must help the Christ hidden in every
Poor man, mm every prisoner, m every sufferer But
if we paraphrased the marvellous scene and apphed

126
“ INTELLIGENCE OF LOVE”

it to the child, we should find that Christ goes io help
all men in the form of the child.

“T loved you, I came to waken you in the morning,
and you drove me away.”

“Lord, when did you ever come into our house in
the mommg to waken us? And when did we drive
you away?”

“The child that was bom of you, who came to
summon you, was I. The child who begged you not
to leave him was I ”

Foolish ones that we are! It was the Messiah!
It was the Messiah, coming to waken us and to teach
us how to love. And we saw only a child’s naughti-
ness and so we have lost our hearts

THE NEW EDUCATION
CHAPTERI
THE TASK OF THE TEACHER
DISCOVERY OF THE TRUE CHILD

We must face the starthng fact that the child has a
psychic hfe of which the delicate mamfestations pass
unperceived, and of which the adult may inadvertently
mar the pattern or binder the development

The adult’s environment 1s not a hife-givmg environ-
ment for the child. Rather it 1s an accumulation of
obstacles, leading him to a creation of defences, to
deforming efforts at adaptation, or else leaving him
the victim of suggestion It is the outward aspect he
thus presents that has been considered in the study
of child psychology , it 1s from this that his charac-
teristics have been defined, as a basis for education
Child psychology 1s thus something that must be
radically revised As we have seen, behind every
surprising response on the part of a child, les an
enigma to be deciphered , every form of naughtmess
1s the outward expression of some deep-seated cause,
which cannot be mterpreted as the superficial, defen-
sive clash with an unsuitable environment, but as ex-
pressing a higher, essential characteristic seeking mami-
festation It 1s as though a storm were hindering the
child’s soul from coming forth from its secret hiding
place, to show itself n the outer world

It 1s plain that all the mcidents that mask the
hidden soul in its contmual endeavours to actualise

130
DISCOVERY OF THE TRUE CHILD

its life, all the fits of temper, struggles, deviations,
give no idea of a personality They are merely a sur
of characteristics. But there must be a personalty
behind them if the child, the spintual embryo, 1s fol-
lowing a constructive pattern m his psychic develop-
ment. There is a hidden man, a hidden child, a
buned living being, who must be htberated Here 1s
the first urgent task of education . liberation in this
sense means knowledge, or indeed a discovery of the
unknown

If there is an essential difference between what
psycho-analysis has discovered and this psychology of
the unknown child, it consists primanly in this: that
what les secret in the subconsciousness of the adult
is something repressed by the individual himself The
individual himself must help to disentangle the tangled
skem formed by complex and resisting adaptations,
by the symbols and camouflage organised dunng a
life-ume. Whereas the secret of the child 1s barely
hidden by his environment. It 1s on the environment
that we must set to work to enable the child to mani-
fest himself freely , the child 1s at a period of creation
and expansion, and it 1s enough to open the door. In-
deed that which he 1s creating, which from not-being
is passing into existence, and from potentiality to
actuality, at the moment when it comes forth from
nothing cannot be complicated, and where it 1s a ques-
ton of an expansive energy there can be no difficulty
in its mansfestaton Thus by prepanng a free envi-
ronment, an environment suited to this moment of
life, natural manifestation of the child's psyche and

131
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

hence the revelation of his secret should come about
spontaneously

Without this principle efforts at education can only
go further and further mto an mextncable maze

* * * *

Here is the aim of the new education ; first of all
to discover the child and effect hus liberation In
this, we may say, hes the first problem of existence
simply to exist There will be a further chapter,
covering the whole period of a child’s development to
adult state, which deals with the problem of the help
that can be offered Imm In both these chapters,
however, the environment 1s fundamental, 1t must
facilitate the expansion of the bemg im process of
development by a reduction of obstacles to a mum-
mum, and must allow free scope for a child’s energies,
by offermg the necessary means for the activities to
which they give mse Now the adult himself 1s part
of the child’s environment , the adult must adjust bum-
self to the child’s needs, if he is not to be a hindrance
to hum and if he 1s not to substitute himself for the
child in the activities essential to growth and develop-
ment.

SPIRITUAL PREPARATION

The teacher must not imagine that he can prepare
humself for hus office merely by study, by becommng a
man of culture He must before all else cultivate m
humself certain aptitudes of a moral order

The crucial pomt of the whole question is the
manner im which he considers the child, and this can-

132

 
SPIRITUAL PREPARATION

not depend on external factors as though it demanded
merely a theoretical knowledge of child nature or of
modes of teaching and correction

Here what we wish to emphasize 1s the fact that
the teacher must prepare himself imvardly. He must
examine himself methodically m order to discover
certain definite defects that may become obstacles in
his treatment of the child To discover defects that
have become part and parcel of his consciousness
requires help and instruction just as we need another
to observe and tell us what hes at the back of our eye

In this sense the teacher needs to be “initiated”
into his or her inner preparation He is too preoccu-
pied with bad tendencies in the child, how to correct
his undesirable actions, or the danger to his soul left
by the residues of ongmal sin

Instead be should begin by seeking out his own
defects, and such tendencies in himself as are not
good First let him remove the beam that 1s in his
own eye, then shall he see more clearly to remove the
mote that 1s im the child’s This inner preparation is
something specific; it 1s not the same as a general
seeking for perfection as in the case of members of
religious communities It 1s not necessary to become
“perfect,” free from every weakness, in order to
become a teacher Indeed it 1s possible for those
continually concerned with the perfection of ther
ner hfe to remain unconscious of the defects that
prevent them from understanding the child. That is
why it 1s necessary to learn, to be guided, to be train-
ed to become teachers of little children

133
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

We have in ourselves tendencies that are not good
and which flourish like weeds ma field (Onrgmal
sm) These tendencies are many , they fall nto seven
groups, known of old as the Seven Deadly Sins

All deadly sin tends to separate us from the child,
for the child, compared to us, 1s not only purer but
has mysterious qualities, which we adults as a rule
cannot perceive, but in which we must believe with
faith, for Jesus spoke of them so clearly and msistently
that all the Evangelists recorded His words “ Un-
less ye be converted and become as httle children, ye
shall not enter nto the Kingdom of Heaven ”

That which the teacher must seek is to be able to
see the child as Jesus saw him It 1s with this endea-
vour, thus defined and delimited, that we wish to deal
The true teacher 1s the man who nds himself of the
ner obstacles which make the child mcomprehen-
sible to hun , he 1s not simply the man who 1s ever
stnving to become better Our instruction to teachers
consists in showing them what inner dispositions they
need to correct, yust as a doctor might pomt out the
particular and definite disease that 1s weakening or
threatening a physical organ

Here, then, 1s some positive help

The sin that arises within us and prevents us from
understanding the child 1s Anger

But simce no deadly sm acts alone, but always mm
combmation or company with another (just as Adam
at once joined Eve when sin made its first appear-
ance), so Anger summons and combines with a sin

134
SPIRITUAL PREPARATION

of more noble appearance and hence more diabolical,
Pride.

The evil tendencies which we have classified as the
Seven Deadly Sims, may be corrected in two ways
One is mterior the individual once he 1s clearly
aware of his defects seeks of his own will, with every
effort, to fight against them and nd himself of them,
by the help of the Grace of God

The other is a social corrective and is found in the
extemal environment It can be defined as a resist-
ance opposed by external forms to the outer mani-
festations of our evil tendencies, thus umpending their
development

This counteractive effort of external forms has
much influence It 1s, one might say, the chief remin-
der of the existence of ourselves of moral defect, and
im many cases it is this external reminder that leads
us to reflect upon ourselves, and thence to work vigor-
ously and earnestly for our inward purification

Let us consider the Seven Deadly Sins Our Pride
is mutigated by other people’s opimion of us; our
Avarice by the circumstances in which we live ; Anger
by the reaction of the strong ; Sloth by the necessity
of working for a hving , Lust by the customs of socie-
ty, Greed: by the limited possibilities of obtaining
more than we need , Envy by the necessity of conserv-
ing an appearance of dignity. Assuredly all this may
be supplemented by the will of the individual to com-
bat Ius defects But these external factors are a con-
tnual and very salutary warning

135
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

The social check, in short, forms a good founda-
tion for the support of our moral equilibnum

We do not, however, feel the same punty when
our actions are moulded by the resistance of society
as when they are performed in obedience to God
On the contrary, while the necessity of a voluntary
correction of recognised errors meets m our soul with
docile acceptance, we adapt ourselves less easily to
the humiliating situation of accepting the control of
others We even feel more humiliated by such enforc-
ed compliance than by the error itself When it 1s
necessary to hold ourselves nm check, when we cannot
do otherwise, an instinct prompts us to uphold our
worldly dignity by making it appear that we chose the
inevitable ourselves The little deceit of saying “I
don’t lke it,” of something beyond our reach 1s one
of the commonest moral pretences

We meet the resistance by a small fiction, but this
means that we are offering battle, not entering upon a
way of perfection

The result 1s that, as m all warfare, organisation
soon becomes plainly desirable , individual tendencies
find refuge im collective tendencies

Persons with the same defect are led mstinctively
to seek ils trumph through umon They build, as
it were, fortifications agamst the hosts that oppose
their capital vices

No one for instance will dare to say that an equit-
able distribution of wealth would displease the nich
because they are grasping and slothful But it will
be said that such a distribution of wealth is beneficial

136
SPIRITUAL PREPARATION

to all, and 1s a necessity of social progress, and then
we shall find even many rich men declaring that they
are resigned to it for the common good. We have an
imstinctive tendency to mask our sins by protestations
of lofty and necessary duties, yust as in the war a strip
of ground dug with trenches or filled with death-deal-
ing devices was camouflaged as a flowery meadow.

The weaker the external forces that oppose our
defects the more time and ease we have to build the
screens to camouflage our defences,

By pausing on these reflections, we come to realise
that we are more attached to our vices than we think ;
we come to see how easy it 1s for the devil to creep in,
teaching us to hide subconsciously even from our-
selves

In this we are defending, not our life, but our
deadly sing It 1s a mask we are only too ready to
put on, calling it “necessity,” “duty,” “the common
good”, and so on, and from all this we find it daily
harder to free ourselves

Now the teacher, or in general anyone wishing to
educate children, must purge himself of that state of
error that puts him in a position of falsity towards
the chdd The prevalent defect must be clearly defin-
ed, and here we are speaking not of one sin, but of a
compost of two mortal sins closely alhed—pride and
anger

Anger 1s truly the essential sin, pride follows to
fend it a pleasing camouflage. Pride cloaks the per-
sonality of the grown-up in a senes of robes which
make it look pleasing and even entitled to respect

137
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

Now, anger 1s one of those sins that are held mn
check by the strong and determmed resistance of
others Anger 1s a mamifestation which a man finds
it hard to accept from others Hence it 1s kept pri-
soner when confronted by strength The man who
speedily finds humself m the humubating position of
bemg forced to retreat becomes ashamed of his anger

We therefore find a real outlet in meetmg persons
unable to defend themselves or to understand, such
as children who beheve everything they are told.
Children not only soon forget our offences, but feel
guilty of all which we accuse them They are like the
holy disciple of St. Francis, who burst into tears
thinking humself a hypocrite, because a priest told bum
so

We would have the teacher here reflect upon the
very serious effect of such conditions on the child’s
life It 1s only the child’s reason that fails to realise
the injustice , his spinit feels 1t and becomes oppressed
or ever deformed Childish reactions then appear, as
expressions of an unconscious defence Tunidity,
lying, caprice, frequent tears without apparent cause,
sleeplessness, every form of exaggerated fear—obscure
things lke these represent unconscious defensive
states in the httle child, whose intelligence is not yet
able to grasp his real relation to the grown-up ,

But anger does not always mean physical violence

The crude, primitive impulse usually understood
by this word may lead to complex manifestations
The man of greater psychological maturity masks and
compheates his mner states of sin

138
SPIRITUAL PREPARATION

In fact, anger in its simple form comes out only as
a reaction to open resistance by the child But m
the presence of more obscure expressions of the child
soul, anger and pride fuse together in a complex whole
which assumes that precise, quiet, and respectable
shape known as tyranny

Here we have an oppression that 1s not disputed,
placmg the tyrannous mdividual m an impregnable
fortress of recognised authority The adult 1s in the
right simply because he is adult. To question this
would be like attacking an established and sacred
form of sovereignty The tyrant in primitive societies
used to be considered as a delegate of God But for
the child the grown-up 1s God Himself The thing 1s
beyond dispute Indeed, the only beng who could
dispute it would be the child, and he remains silent
He adapts himself to everything, believes everything,
forgives everythmg When cuffed, he does not reta-
hate, and he willingly asks the angry grown-up to
pardon him, forgetting even to ask wherem he has
offended

Yet the child does occasionally act m self-defence,
but his defence 1s hardly ever a direct and intentional
reply to the action of the adult It is either a vital

defence of his psychic integrity, or else an unconscious
reaction of the oppressed spinit

Only as the child grows older does he begin to direct
his reactions against the tyranny itself, but then the
adult finds justificatory reasons wherewith to entrench
himself sull more firmly behind his camouflage, and

139
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

succeeds sometimes in convincing even the child that
such tyranny 1s for his good

“Respect” 1s on one side only , the weak respecting
the strong

It 1s thought legitumate for the adult to “offend” the
child He can judge the child, or speak il of hum,
and does it openly, even so as to hurt his feelmgs

The child’s needs are durected or suppressed by the
adult at will A protest from the child 1s considered
as isubordination that it would be dangerous to
tolerate

This 1s a form of government on a primitive model,
when the subjects have only to pay their taxes without
question There have been peoples who believed that
every good was secured to them by the beneficence of
their sovereign, and in the same way the populace of
children thinks that it owes all to the adult Or rather,
it is the adult who bekeves this His camouflage of
creator 1s organised He in his pride believes that
he creates in the child all that he 1s It 1s the adult
who makes the child intelligent, good, and religious ,
provides him, that is, with the means he will need for
communication with his environment, with men, and
with God This is a fatiguing task. The tyrant’s
self-abnegation completes his tyranny Where 1s the
tyrant who ever confessed to sacrificing his subjects ?

The preparation our method demands of the teacher
is that he should examine himself, and purge himself
of his sins of tyranny , he must tear down that ancient
complex of pride and anger that unconsciously encrusts
hus heart , stp humself of pride and anger and become

140
HOW IT ORIGINATED

humble , this first of all, then re-clothe himself mn
charity These are the mental dispositions he has to
acquire This 1s the central point of balance without
which it 1s impossible to proceed This is lus “traming,”
its starting point, and its goal

We do not mean that he must approve all the child’s
acts or refram from judging him, or that nothmg has
to be done to develop his intelligence or feelings
Quite the contrary , it must not be forgotten that the
aim 1s to educate, to become a real teacher to the child

But first comes an act of humulity, the rooting-out
of a prejudice embedded in our hearts, just as the
pnest before gomg up to the altar must recite his
Confiteor

So, and not otherwise

We do not hold that the chud should be denied such
help as education can give him, but that there must
be a radical change in our own inner state, which pre-
vents us as adults from understanding him

CuapTer IL
, OUR OWN METHOD

HOW IT ORIGINATED

Our own method of education 1s characterised by
the central importance that we attribute to the question
of environment Another innovation that has aroused
much interest and controversy has been the role of the
teacher—the passive teacher who holds his own acti-
vities and authority in abeyance, lest they should be
an obstacle preventing the child from acting for him-

THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

self, and who 1s glad when he sees the child so acting,
making progress on his own, and seeks no credit for
it. He apples to himself the words of St John the
Baptist “He must increase but I must decrease”
Another characteristic principle 1s respect for the child’s
personality, carried to a degree unattained m any other
educational method

These three essential points were developed in spe-
cial schools, which were called m the beginning Case
det Bambim, lterally children’s homes, for we wished
to maintam the idea of a family Those who have
followed this educational movement know that it has
always aroused much discussion, especially m view of
the reversed roles of adult and child the teacher who
does so httle actual teaching, with the child the centre
of activity, learmmg by himself, left free m his choice
of occupation and in his movements This, when it
was not considered an utopia, was held to be an exag-
geration Whereas our conception of a material en-
vironment in which everything should be m proportion
to the size of a child, has been well received The
clear, light rooms, with little low windows, wreathed
in flowers, with small pieces of furniture of every shape
just like the furniture of a nicely furmshed home, little
tables, ttle armchairs, pretty curtaims, low cupboards
within reach of the children’s hands, where they can
put things and from which they can take what they
want, all this seemed a real, practical provement mn

HOW IT ORIGINATED

To-day, after long research and experiment, we feel
a need to return to the question, and especially to ex-
plam how our method onginated

Tt would be a great mistake to believe that by observ-
ing children we were led to frame such a bold idea as
that of the existence of a hidden nature in the child,
and that such an intuition in ats turn gave mse to the
idea of a special school and a special method of educa-
tion It 1s mmpossible to observe something that is
not known, and it 1s not possible for anyone all at once,
by a vague intuition, to imagine that a child may have
two natures and to say, “Now I will try to prove it by
experiment” Anything new must emerge, so to speak,
by its own energies , it must spring forth and stnke
the mind, evoked by what we call chance Often there
18 NO one more mcredulous than the person to whom
this happens , he reyects the new fact just like everyone
else The novelty must present itself agai and again
before it as finally seen, recogmsed and eagerly received
Then indeed the eagerness with which he who per-
Ceives it welcomes the new light, cherishes it, enthuses
over it and dedicates his life to it may make others
believe that it was his creation Whereas he has merely
teached a point where he could recogmse it, and has
done ke the man in the Bible, who, when he had
found one pearl of great price, went lis way and sold
all that he had and bought at Our difficulty hes in

to what constitutes a new phenomenon A new phe-
nomenon is an mutial discovery of facts previously un-
known and therefore unsuspected, that 1s to say, that
were as if they did not exist A fact 1s always objec-
tive and therefore cannot depend on an intuition
When it 1s a case of proving the existence of a new
fact, 1 must be proved that it exists of itself, that 1s,
it must be isolated Then comes a second phase, the
study of circumstances in which the new phenomenon
shows itself, so that we may reproduce it and thus
perpetuate it Only when this fundamental problem
has been solved 1s it possible to study the phenomenon ,
it is then that research begins, and, finding new things
on the new path, mvestigators may make genume dis-
coveries This 1s another matter, it 1s clear that no
one can search for something he does not know exists
Research must be an anti-chamber, it implies an
apparition There is a form of studies exclusively

concerned with reproducing, matntaming and gaining
mastery over a phenomenon, so that it shail not vanish

Possession, and hence a real value

Now the first Casa de: Bambini was not a place
arranged for a determined expermment, or for scientific
research It provides an examplle of an muttal dis-
covery which had all the features of an “unknown”
Presenting itself before it had been recogmsed, of a
tnvial fact able to open Wlimitable horizons

Something I wrote long ago, which I have dis-
Covered in a heap of old papers, may be of documen-
tary interest m this respect.

“WHO ARE YOU?”

“Tt was January 6th (1906), when the first school
Was opened for small, normal children of between
three and six years of age I cannot say on my
methods, for these did not yet exist. But im the school
that was opened my method was shortly to come into
bemg On that day there was nothing to be seen but
about fifty wretchedly poor children, rough and shy
in manner, many of them crymg, almost all the children
of dhterate parents, who had been entrusted to my care

“The imitial plan was to gather together the small
children of the workmen living in a workers’ tenement,
So that they should not be left to play on the stairs
and dirty the walls or create disorder With this end
im view a room had been provided for them in the
tenement. I had been asked to take charge of this
Austitution, which ‘might have a future’.

Tl believe it next time’ Thus for a long tume I
remained incredulous, and at the same time deeply
stured and trepidant. How many times did I not re-
prove the children’s teacher when she told me what
the children had done of themselves ? ‘The only thing
that impresses me 1s truth, I would reply severely
And I remember that the teacher answered, without
taking offence, and often thoved to tears ‘You are
night When I see such things I think :t must be the
holy angels who are mspiring these children’

“One day, m great emotion, I took my heart m
my two hands as though to encourage it to mse to
the heights of faith, and I stood respectfully before.
the children, saying to myself ‘Who are you then?
Have I perhaps met with the children who were held
in Christ's arms and to whom divine words were
spoken ? I will follow you, to enter with you
into the Kingdom of Heaven’

“And holding in my hand the torch of faith, I went
on my way”

THE FIRST CHILDREN

It was thus that chance led me to them They
were tearful, fmghtened children, so shy that it was
impossible to get them to speak, their faces were
expressionless, with bewildered eyes as though they
had never seen anything in ther hives They were
indeed poor, abandoned children, who had grown up
in dark, tumble-down cottages, with nothing to stimu-
late their minds, and without care Everyone could
see they suffered from malnutrition , it was not neces-

148
THE FIRST CHILDREN

sary to be a doctor to recognise that they were m
urgent need of food, open air life and sunlight They
were Closed flowers, but without the freshness of buds,
souls concealed beneath a hermetic shell

It would be interesting to know the original
circumstances that enabled these children to undergo
such an extraordinary transformation, or rather, that
brought about the appearance of new children, whose
Souls revealed themselves with such radiance as to
spread a hight through the whole world

These circumstances must have been singularly
favourable to enable the “liberation of the soul of
the child”. All repressive obstacles must have been
ehminated. But who could have told im what such
obstacles consisted? And what were the favourable,
or mdeed necessary circumstances, that enabled a
buried soul to come forth and flower? Many would
have seemed the exact opposite to what was required
for such a lofty goal

Let us begin with the famuy circumstances of these
children They came from the lowest strata of
Society, for their fathers were not workmen im regular
employment, but casual workers who sought for tem-
porary work from day to day, and who therefore
could not look after their children Nearly all were
ultterate,

Since it was not possible to find a proper mistress
for a post that offered no future prospects, the first
idea was that the porter’s daughter should be em-
Ployed more or less as a guardian ; Jater a better
educated gurl was engaged, who, though she had once

paper, which accordmg to her would serve as rewards
for the best behaved children Indeed, I often saw
one or other of them wearing one of these harmless
decorations on his breast She had also taken upon
herself to teach them all to make a military salute,
though most of the children were little girls and the
eldest were only five But this seemed to give her
satisfaction, and I found the whole thing as unmmport-
ant as it was silly

Thus our life of peace and isolation started, and
for a long time no one knew of our existence

WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

I should ke to summanse just the principal events
of this period, though to do so 1s to speak of such
infimtesimal things that they would belong better to
those children’s stones that begin “Once upon a time

” than to a solemn treatise My own actions
in the matter were so simple, so truly puerile, that
no one would wish to take them seriously from a
scientific pomt of view None the less a methodical
description would mean a volume of psychological
observations, or better, of discoveries

“Repetition of the Exercise”

The first phenomenon that awoke my attention
was that of a little girl of about three who was prac-
tising shipping our series of solid cylinders in and out
of the block (they go in and out of the holes like the
corks of bottles, but they are cylinders of graduated
size and each one has its own special place) I was

152
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

surprised to see so small a child repeating an exercise
over and over again with the keenest mterest She
showed no progress in speed or skill; st was a kind
of perpetual motion My habit of measuring things
led me to begin to count the number of times she re-
peated the exercise Then I thought I would see
how far the strange concentration she showed could
withstand disturbance, and I told the teacher to make
the other children sing and move about. They did
so, but the little girl did not stop her work for an
instant, Then I gently picked up the armchair in
which she sat, with her im it, and put it on a little
table. She had clutched her cylinders to her, and
putting them on her knees, contmued her task. From
the time when I had begun to count, she had repeated
the exercise forty-two times. She stopped, as though
coming out of a dream, and smiled as if she were very
happy Her eyes shone, and she looked about her

It seemed that she had not even noticed out various
manoeuvers, which had not succeeded mn disturbing
her And now, for no visible reason, her task was
finished. What was finished, and why?

Here was a first peep into the unexplored depths of
the child mind. Here was a very small child, at an
age when attention flats from one thing to another and
cannot be held down Yet she had been absorbed m
a concentration such that her ego had withdrawn itself
from reach of any external stimulus That concen-
tration was accompanied by a rhythmic movement of

the hands, evoked by an accurately made, scientifically
graduated object.

153
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

Similar facts occurred on various occasions An
every time the children emerged as if rested, full «
Infe, with the look of those who have experienced som
great joy

Though such instances of a concentration reachir
insensibihty to the outer world were not usual,
noticed a peculiar behaviour that was common to a!
and practically the rule in all they did—the speci
charactenstic of child work, which I later calle
“repetition of the exercise”

Watching those dirty little hands at work I thoug!
one day that I would teach the children something n
ally useful, how to wash their hands I noticed th
the children, once thew hands were clean, went ¢
washing them They came out of school and wei
to wash their hands Some of the mothers told n
that m the mormmng their children had run out of tt
house, and had been found at the washing tank
washing ther hands They were proud to show ever
one their clean hands, so much so that they were onc
mistaken for beggars They repeated the performanc
again and again without having any longer an extern
aim im domg so It was by an inner need that the
went on washing hands that were already clean Tt
same thing happened on many other occasions, tt
more accurately an exercise was taught 1n all its detail
the more it seemed to become a stimulus to an en
less repetition of the same exercise

Their feeling for Order \
Another detail came to light for the first time as th

154
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

result of a very simple incident The children used
the apparatus made for them, but it was the teacher
who distributed it and put it back in its place She
told me that when she was doing this the children
got up and came to stand around her. She sent them
to their seats, but they always came back. This hap-
pened many times, and she had concluded that they
were being disobedient. When I watched them, I
understood that what they wanted was themselves to
put the various objects back, and I left them free to
do so Thus, a kind of new hfe began for them; to
put things tidy, to tidy up any disorder that might
have arisen, became an enthralling occupation If
a glass of water fell from a child’s hands, others ran
to pick up the pieces and dry the floor. One day
the teacher dropped a box contamung eighty tablets of
various graduated colours. I remember her confusion,
for it was difficult to recognise so many shades of
colour, so as to know where each belonged But at
once the children ran to her, and to our amazement
quickly put all the tablets m their places, correctly
graduated, showing a wonderful sensibility to the
colours, such as we did not possess

“Free Choice”

One day the teacher came to school a little late.
She had forgotten to lock the cupboard, and she found
that many children had opened the door and were
standmg round it, Some were taking things from it
and carrying'them away. The teacher decided that
this revealed a thieving instinct. Children who stole

155
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

and showed a lack of respect for ther school and their
teacher, must, she said, be treated with severity and
would have to be taught the difference between mght
and wrong I, on the contrary, felt I should mterpret
the :mcident as implying that the children now knew
the various objects and were able to choose among
them. Thus, in fact, was the case A hvely and im-
teresting form of activity now began The children had
their special preferences and chose their own occupa-
tions To enable them to do so, we later maugurated
low, pretty cupboards, m which the apparatus was
placed at the disposition of the children, who could
choose what corresponded to their mner needs Thus
the Principal of free choice accompamed that of repe-
tition of the exercise

They never chose the Toys

Though the school contamed some really wonder-
ful toys, the children never chose them This surprised
me so much that I myself intervened, to show them
how to use such toys, teaching them how to handle the
doll’s crockery, lighting the fire in the tiny doll’s kitchen,
setting a pretty doll beside it. The children showed
interest for a time, but then went away, and they never
made such toys the objects of theur spontaneous choice
And so I understood that in a child’s life play 1s per-
haps something mferor, to which he has recourse for
want of something better, but that there were loftier
things which, in the child’s mind, seemed to take prece-
dence over useless amusements The same might be
said of ourselves , to play chess or bridge 1s pleasant

156
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

enough for our leisure moments, but it would no longer
be at we were forced to do nothing else all through
our life, When there is a lofty and urgent task to be
done, bridge 1s forgotten, and the child has always lofty,
and indeed urgent, tasks before him. Every passing
munute is precious to him, representing the passage for
a slightly mfenor state of bemg to a higher one The
child 1s continually growing, and all that has to do with
the means of his development fascinates hum and makes
hum forget idle occupations The pmnciple of free
choice made it possible to observe the tendencies and
psychic needs of the children. One of the first inter-
esting tesults was the discovery that the children did
not choose all the scientific matenal that had been pre-
pared, but only some of it. They chose more or less
the same things , others came second Others imstead
remamed forsaken and became covered with dust I
used to put all before them, I saw that the teacher did
the same, explamng their use, but some of them the

children never chose spontaneous

ly I then understood
that in the child’s environment everything must be
measured besides being mm order, and that interest
and concentration Spting precisely from the absence
of confusion or superflunty

Rewards and Punshments

One day on coming mto the sch
siting in 2 Lene 0 school I saw a child
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

tom of the people ; its face was fat and pwk, and it did
not cry. The silence of the little creature struck me,
and I wanted the children to share my feeling “See,”
I sad, “it isn’t making a sound’. And, joking, I
added, “Look how still it keeps its feet. | None of
you could keep as still as that.” (I was pointing out
how the baby’s feet were bound mm swaddling bands)

To my amazement I saw an extraordinary tension in
the children who watched me; all held thew feet
motionless together. It seemed as though they were
hanging ‘on my lips, and felt deeply all I was saying

“Then its breathing”, I went on, “how soft it is.
None of you could breathe as it does, without making
a sound ” The children, surprised and motion-
less, held their breath In that moment there was an
extraordinary silence; the tick of the clock, which
generally could not be heard, became perceptible It
seemed as if the baby had brought with it an atmos-
phere of silence such as does not exist mm ordinary life.
This was because no one was making the smallest
movement And from this came the wish to listen to
the silence, and hence to reproduce it The children
all sought to do so, eagerly, of eagerness did not imply
an impulsiveness that must find outward expression

Here instead was the expression of a correspondence
born of deep-seated desire At once the children sat
sull, controlling even their breathing, and so they re-
mamed, with the serene, intense look of those engaged
‘meditation Little by little im that impressive silence
Uttle noises were heard, a drop of water falling in the

159
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

distance, the far-off twitter of a bird. This incident
was the origin of our silence exercise

One day I had the idea of using silence to test the
children’s keenness of hearing, so I thought of callmg
them by name, in a low whisper, from a certain
distance, as 1s the custom im certam medical tests
The child called was to come up to me, walking so as
not to make asound With forty children this exercise
am patient waiting demanded a patience that I thought
impossible, so I brought with me some sweetsyas a re-
ward for each child who came tome But thé children
refused the sweets They seemed to say, “Don’t spol
our lovely experience, we are still filled with delight
of the spirit, don’t distract us” And so I realised that
children were sensible not only to silence but to a
voice calling imperceptibly m silence They came up
slowly, walking on tip-toe, taking care not to knock
into things, and their footsteps could scarcely be heard.
Later it became clear to me that every exercise m
movement that is susceptible of control by error, as
in this case by novses im a silence, helps to guide
children to perfect ther powers , and thus the repet-
tion of the exercise may lead to an external trammng
im action, so delicate that it would be umpossible to
obtain it by external teachmg Our children learned
to move among things without knocking into them,
to run hghtly without making a noise, and so became
alert and agile And they rejoiced in the Perfection
of their achievements What interested them was to
discover themselves, their capacites, and to gam

160
WHAT THEY SHOWED MS

practice in a mysterious world like that of evolving
hfe

They refused Sweets

It needed a long time for us to convince ourselves
that the children’s refusal of sweets and its intrinsic
Teason—sweets, whether given as prizes or otherwise,
and which represented unnecessary and irregular food
This seemed to me so extraordinary that I wished to
Tepeat the test again and again, for everyone knows
that children are always greedy for sweets I took
sweets to school, but the children refused them or
put them in their overall pockets. Thmking that since
they were poor they wanted to take the sweets home
to their families, I told them, “These sweets‘are for
you, and here are others for you to take home” They
took them, but they put them all in their overall
pockets, and did not eat them. Yet they appreciated
them as gifts, for once, when one of these children
was ill in bed and the mistress came to sec him, he
was so grateful that he opened a little box and took
out a big sweet which had been given him at school,
and offered it to her. That sweet had remained by
him to tempt him for weeks, but he had not touched
it Was it a feeling lke that of the monks who flee
from ease and from such outward things as are useless
to the tmue good of life, once they have risen on the
ladder of spintual hfe? It 1s certain that this pheno-
menon was so general among the children that in
later schools not a few visitors came on purpose to
very it, and wrote about it in many books, Here

161
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

was a spontaneous and natural psychological fact
Of course, no one thought of teachmg penance and
abolishing sweets, no one could have had such an
extraordinary and fantastic idea as to assert “Children
should not play or eat sweets” When fantasy gets
to work it does not do so on things of this kmd
Cunous anecdotes were told m the matter, like that
which went round the world, about an mmportant
personage who distnbuted biscmts which happened
to be of geometncal shapes, and how the children,
mstead of eating them, looked at them with interest,
saying “That’s a cycle! That's a rectangle!”
There 1s another pretty story of a little child of poor
parents who was watching his mother cookmg She
picked up an intact piece of butter and the child said
“It’s a rectangle” She cut off a comer and he said,
“Now you've taken a triangle,” adding, “And it
Jeaves a trapezmm” And he never uttered the usual
plea “Give me some bread and butter”

Their Sense of Dignity

ican tell of other incidents that pointed to curious
charactenstics One day I thought of giving a rather
humorous lesson on how you blow your nose After
having imitated various ways of usmg a handkerchuef
for this purpose, I ended by showing how it can be
done discreetly, so as to make as hittle noise as possi-
ble, shppmg out the handkerchief so that the action
remains more or less indden. The children listened
and watched with the keenest attention, and did not
laugh, and I wondered to myself what could be the

14>
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

teason But hardly had I finished than there came
a burst of applause, uke when in the theatre a great
actress evokes an ovation repressed with difficulty
Then indeed I was utterly amazed I had never heard
it said that such small children could turn into an
applauding audience, or that small hands could ex-
press themselves with so much wgour It occurred
to me that perhaps I had touched on a sensitive spot
in the social life of this little world The question I
had treated was one that children associate with a
kind of contmual humiliation, a permanent derision ,
they are always bemg scolded about blowing their
noses. Everyone shouts at them, everyone msults
them, and im the end, especially in schools, handker-
chiefs are pmned visibly to their overalls, so that they
shall not lose them The handkerchief then 1s bke
4 stigma and badge of infamy. No one had ever
taught them without attacking them directly how they
ought to blow their noses We should put ourselves
in their place, or better, we should understand that
children are sensitive to all the derision that 1s shower-
ed upon them, and which leaves them with a sense
of humiliation Such a lesson as mine did them yus-
ce, redeemed them, enabled them to raise themselves
in social life. That was bow I had to mterpret it,
for afterwards, through long experience, I discovered
that children have a profound feeling of personal
dignity and that their souls may remain wounded,
Ueerated, oppressed, in a way the adult can never
have imagined.

That day did not end so When I was going away

163
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the children began to shout “Thank you! Thank
you for the lesson” And when I went out they came
behind me into the street, m a silent procession along
the pavement, till I told them “When you go back,
run on tip-toe and take care not to knock mto the cor-
ner of the wall” They tumed round and disappear-
ed through the gates as though on wings I had m-
deed touched these poor little children im their social
dignity

One day an important visit was announced from
someone who wished to remain alone with the children
to observe them I urged the teacher “For this
occasion, let everythmg happen spontaneously” And
turning to the children, I told them “To-morrow
you will have a visitor How I would hke him to
think, ‘these children are the best im the world’ ”

Later, I asked how the visit had gone off “It was
a great success,” the teacher told me “The children
prepared a chair and sard to the visitor, ‘Won’t you
sit down?’ And others said, ‘Good mornmg’ Then
when he went away, all crowded to look out of the
window, shouting ‘Thank you for your visit, good-bye’

“But why all these compliments and preparations ?”
Tasked “I told you to do nothing out of the usual,
and to let everythmg happen naturally”

“But I didn’t say a word to them,” she replied.
“It was they themselves » And she added, “Even
I couldn’t beheve my eyes, and I said to myself that
it must be the angels inspurmg them ” She went on
to tell me that the children had done thei work well,

164
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

each taking a different task, and gomg on with it so
quietly that the visitor was really moved.

For a long time I remamed doubtful and incre-
dulous, tormenting the teacher to make sure that there
were no preparations or rehearsals But at last I
understood. The children bad their own sense of
dignity, their own amour propre, and they knew how
to orgamise thew school work and how to receive visits
with gratitude and cordial pleasure. They paid honour
to their visitors, they were proud to show the best
they could do Had I not said to them, “I should
lke it to be thought that these children are the best
in the world”? But it was certainly not through my
exhortation that they acted as they did. It was
enough to say, “You are to have a visitor,” just as
one announces a visitor in a drawing-room, and there
was that little world alert and responsible, full of dig-
nity and courtesy, to do the rest

I understood then something very simple and yet
almost supernatural. The children had no shyness.
No obstacles had been set between their souls and
their surroundings, they had expanded fully and
naturally, lke lotus flowers opening their white petals
to the full to the rays of the sun, and sending forth
a delicate fragrance. They had nothmng to hide, no-
thing to shut away, nothing to fear. That was all.
Their ease was the result, we may say, of an imme-
diate and perfect adaptation to their environment.
Alert, active minds were at work in the world, finding
themselves always at ease, sending forth a spiritual
light and warmth that melted the oppressive toils

165
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

round the souls of those adults who came into contact
with them These children welcomed all with love
It was thus that important people began to pay them
wisits to receive new, refreshing impressions, and the
children became the centre of an intense social life
It was cunous to see how even ordinary visitors began
to show feelngs quite other than what was usual with
them Ladhes, for example, would put on their most
elegant clothes and jewelry, as if to call on some one
they wished to honour, and they rejoiced in the admi-
ration of the children, so fresh and naive, and devoid
of envy , they were happy to hear how the httle ones
expressed their compliments

The children stroked the fine stuffs and the soft
perfumed hands of such ladies Once a little boy
went up to a lady m deep mourning and leant his
head against her, then he took her hand and held it
between his own She said afterwards with much
emotion that no one had given her such comfort as
that child

Spontaneous Disciphne

In spite of this ease and freedom of manner, the
children as a whole gave an unpression of extraordi-
nary discipline They worked quietly, each one m-
tent on his own task , they went about walking quiet-
ly, to get fresh work or to put back what they had
been domg They went out of the room, gave a
glance at the courtyard, and came back. They ful-
filled the wishes expressed by their teacher with an
amazing rapidity She told me, “They are so ready

116A
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

to do what I say that I begin to feel a sense of respon-
sibihty for every word I utter” Indeed if she wanted
to ask them to do the silence exercise, the words were
not out of her mouth before the children all sat motion-
less. “We shall now keep sil . .” In spite of this
apparent dependence, they knew how to act on their
own, arranging their own time and their day They
took their own material, put the school tidy, and if
‘the teacher came late, or went out leaving them alone,
everything went just as well this indeed was the
chief attraction for those who observed them — order
and disciphne combined with spontaneity
Whence came this perfect discipline, so apparent
even when it showed itself in deep silence, this obe-
dience that made them so ready to do what they were
told? The quiet m class when the children were at
work was complete and movmg No one had en-
forced 1t, and what is more, no one could have obtain-
ed it by external means Had these children may be
found the orbit of their cycle, like stars that circle
unwearying and which without departing from their
order shine through eternity? Of these the Bible
speaks, in words that could be applied to such chil-
dren, “And the stars have given hight m their watches
and rejoiced they were fullness they have shined forth
to bim that made them” A natural discipline of this
kind seems to transcend its ummediate environment,
and to show itself as part of a universal discipine ruling
the world. It 1s of such discipline that the prophet
speaks as of something men have lost. “Young men
have seen the Lght and dwelt upon the earth, but the

167
1
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

way of disciphne they have not known” One has the
impression that this natural discipline must provide the
foundation for all other forms of discipline determmed
—like that of social hfe, for stance—by outward and
ummediate considerations One of the things, indeed,
which aroused the greatest mterest and gave greatest
food for thought, seeming as it did to hold something
mysterious, was precisely this fact of order and disci-
pline so closely umited as to result m freedom

One day a lady, the daughter of our Prime Minster,
wished to accompany the Argentine Ambassador on a
vistt to the Casa de: Bambin. The Ambassador had
decided to give no warning of his visit, so that he might
see the spontaneity of which he had been told. But,
when he arrived, he learned that the day was a hohday
and that the school was closed In the courtyard were
some of the children, who at once came uptohim “It
doesn’t matter if it 1s a hokday”, said one, quite
naturally, “for we are all at home, and the porter has
the key” They began to run about, calling ther com-
rades by name, and, having got the door open, all sat
down to work Thus their marvellous spontaneity was
proved beyond all question

“I've Written! I’ve Written!”

The children’s mothers were aware of such acts It
can be umagined how amazed were the families mn the
tenement when they saw the-visitors who came into
the courtyard to see their children—the Queen of Italy,
the King lumself, and a number of exalted personages
they had never expected to see even from a distance

168
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

But st was not of this that they used to talk to me
They came instead to confide mtmate family details.
“These little ones of three and four,” they told me,
“say things to us that would offend us from anyone
else They say, for mstance , “You've got dirty hands,
you ought to wash them You ought to wash the spots
on your dress’ When we hear this from them, we
aren’t offended. They tell us of things just lke m
dreams” The fact was that all these working people
were becoming cleaner and tidier Broken saucepans
began to disappear from the window sills Little by
little the windows became clean and geraniums appear-
ed on the sulls round the courtyard But the most 1m~
pressive fact was that often some poor woman would
put on the school window sill, which was on the ground
floor, some favourite dish she had cooked and which she
wished to offer the mistress as a sign of gratitude, with-
out letting her know who had given it. Once two or
three mothers came to me in a deputation, asking me
to teach their children how to read and write They
themselves were literate. And as I made objections,
feeling that such an undertaking was out of my scope,
they begged me insistently,

It was then that the most surprising things of all
happened All I taught the children of four and five
was some of the letters of the alphabet, which I made
the mistress cut out of cardboard. I also had some
cut out of shiny paper, so that the children could
touch them with their finger-tips, feelng out the shapes
as for wnting; these I arranged on a board, putting
together the letters of similar shape so that the move-

169
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

ment of the little hands should be umform The mis-
tress hked the idea, and was content to remain at this
common and primitive beginning

I could ‘not understand why the children were so
keen they made processions carrying the letters aloft
luke banners with shouts of joy Why? One day I
surprised a child who was walking by himself repeat~
ing “To make sofia you want S, O, F, I, A,” and he
repeated the sounds making up the word, He was
engaged in a study, analysing the words he had in his
mund and hunting for the sounds of which they were
composed

With the profound interest of one who has made a
discovery, he had understood that each of these sounds
corresponded to a letter of the alphabet Indeed, what
1s alphabetical wnting, if not the correspondence of
a sign with a sound? Language in itself 1s spoken
Janguage , written language 1s nothing else than a really
Iiteral translation All the progress of alphabetical
wniting springs from this pomt of contact from which
the two languages can evolve im parallel. In the
beginning the one, the written language, falls from the
other drop by drop, and these will later form a dis-
funct stream words and discourse

Here 1s a real secret, a key which, once discovered,
brings a two-fold gam It allows the hand to master
a vital, almost unconscious labour, such as spoken
language, and to create another language reflecting it
in every detail. Head and hand are both the gamers
‘The hand gives a fresh impetus, and the drops become
a waterfall The whole language comes to have its

170
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

written counterpart For it 1s a stream, a waterfall,
and yet made up of little drops of sound

Once an alphabet has been formed, written language
should derive from it logically, as a natural consequ-
ence For this the hand must have the ability to trace
signs Alphabetical signs which are mere symbols
making no attempt at representation are, therefore,
very easy to draw But on all these things I had never
reflected when the greatest event of all took place in
the Casa der Bambi.

One day a child began to write He was so asto-
mished that he shouted aloud, “I’ve wntten! I’ve
written” Other children rushed up to hum, full of n-
terest, starting at the words that their play-fellow had
traced on the ground with a piece of white chalk “I
too! Itoo! shouted the others, and ran off. They
ran to find a means of wniting ; some crowded round
the blackboard, others stretched themselves on the
ground, and thus written language began to develop as
an explosion This tireless activity was truly lke a
torrent They wrote everywhere—on doors, walls,
and even at home on loaves of bread They were
about four years old The power of wnting appeared
as an unexpected event. The teacher would tell me,
for instance, “This child began to write yesterday at
3pm”

We felt as though we were in the presence of a
miracle But when we gave books to the children (and
many people who had heard of what had happened
brought us some very fine picture books), these books
were coldly received, as things with pretty pictures but

171
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

distracting from the enthralling and wholly absorbing
task of wmting Perhaps those children had never
seen books, but for a long time we tried im vain to
make them take an mterest im them It was not even
possible to make them understand what reading meant.
So we put the books away, till a more propitious time
They did not even read what was written by hand It
was rare for one of them to bother to read what another
had written , indeed, they seemed incapable of reading
the words Many children turned round to look at
me with astonishment when I read aloud the words
they had written, as though they asked, “How do you
know ?”

Reading came Later

It was about six months later that they began to
understand what reading meant, and they did so only
through associating it with wntng Their eyes fol-
lowed my hands as it traced the signs on paper, and
they grasped the idea that thus I was expressmmg my
thoughts as if I were speaking Barely had this idea
become clear than they sewed the pieces of paper on
which I had wnitten, to carry them off to a corner and
try to read them, and they read them mentally, without
pronouncing a sound One knew that they had under-
stood from the smile that suddenly appeared on the
small face for a moment earlier contracted by effort,
or from a [little jump that seemed evoked by a hidden
spring Then they would set to work For each
sentence I had wnitten was an order, such as I might
have made by word of mouth “Open the window,”

172
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

“Come close to me”, etc That was how they began
to read Soon they were able to read long sentences,
ordering complicated actions. But it seemed that
written language was understood by children merely
as another way of expressing themselves, another form
of spoken language meant in the same way to be trans-
mitted directly from one person to another

Indeed now when visitors came, many children who
had earher exceeded m vocal greetmg were silent
They got up and went to wnite on the blackboard, “Sit
down, thank you for the visit,” etc. Once they were
told of a terrible disaster in Sicily, where an earthquake
had utterly destroyed the city of Messina, leaving
hundreds of thousands of victims. A child about five
years old got up and went to write on the blackboard.
He began thus. “I am sorry. .” We watched
hum, expecting he would say he was sorry about the
disaster Instead he wrote “I am sorry that I am
little” It seemed a strangely egotistical reflection.
But he went on. “If I was big I should go to help”
He had made a little composition, revealing at the
same time his generous heart He was the son of a
woman who kept him by selling herbs in a basket in
the street

Later on, something equally surprising happened
While we were preparing matenals for teaching the
punted alphabet, un order to give the books another
try, the children began to read all the pnnted matter
in the school Some of this was really difficult to
decipher, such as a calendar on which words were
printed in gothic lettering At the same time their

173
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

parents came to tell us that in the street the children
would stop to read shop-signs, so that it was impossible
to go out for walks with them It was plain that the
children were interested not im reading the words, but
im puzzling out the alphabetical signs Here was
another form of wntimg which they wished to learn,
and they could do so precisely by elucidating the sense
of the words Their minds were working m the same
way as that of the adult who pores over a pre-historic
scription, till the sense he gathers from st proves to
hum that he has correctly deciphered the signs he did
not know The children’s sudden, passionate interest
an anything in print sprang from such a motive

Jf we had been m too much of a hurry to explain
the pmnted characters, we should have quenched thew
interest and eagerness to puzzle out the unfamiliar An
untimely insistence on their reading words from books
would have been the reverse of helpful , by presenting
an unimportant finality it would have dimimished the
energy of those dynamic minds

And so the books femained for a further penod
shut up im the cupboards It was only later that the
children came into relationship with books It began
with a really thrilling event. A child came to school
full of excitement, hiding in hus hand a crumpled piece
of paper, and confided to a fend, “Guess what’s m
this piece of paper” “There’s nothing , it’s a torn bit
of paper” “No, there’s a story ” A story wit?
This at once drew an terested crowd The child
had picked up the paper from a rubbish heap And
he began to read, to read the story Then at last they

174
WHAT THEY SHOWED ME

grasped the significance of books, and after this, the
books went hke hot cakes But many of the children,
when they found an interesting story, tore out the page
and carned it away

Those books! The discovery of their value was
truly staggering The habitual peaceful order of the
school was overthrown, and it was necessary to con-
trol those eager httle hands that destroyed out of pure
love Even before they could read the books and
learn to respect them, the children, with some help,
had learned to spell, and they wrote so well that they
could be compared to children in Class III of the ele-
mentary schools

“New Cluldren”

During the tume they had been at school, nothing had
been done to umprove the physical conditions of the
children But now no one would have recognised m
their rosy faces and their alert looks the underfed
anaemic children who had seemed im urgent need of
medical care, food, and tonics. They were as healthy
as if they had completed an open air and sun cure
Indeed, if depressive psychological causes can have an
influence on the metabolism so as to lower vitality, the
contrary can come about, that is, stimulating psycho-
Jogical causes can crease the activity of the metabo-
lism and of all physical functions Of this we had
here a proof To-day this would not create any sur-
prise, but in those days it aroused amazement.

All this made people talk of “miracles”, and so elo-
quently did the press speak of them that the news of

175
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the wonderful children spread in a trice all over the
world Books were written on those children , they
inspired novelists who, in giving exact descriptions of
what they bad seen, seemed to be depicting an unknown
world People spoke of the discovery of the human
soul, they spoke of miracles, they quoted child conver-
sions The latest English book dealing with them 1s
called New Children From distant countries, and
especially from America, many people came to verify
the surprismg facts Our children might well have
repeated the biblical words that are read im church on
January 6th, the feast of the Magi, the day of the
opening of the school “Lift up thme eyes round
about and see alll these are gathered together they
are come to thee the multitude from beyond the sea
shall be converted to thee”

CHAPTER III
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS
THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED

Txis brief account of mcidents and impressions will
have thrown iittle ight on the question of “method”
By what method were such results obtained ?

Here 1s the pomt

One cannot see the method, one sees the child
One sees the child soul, freed from obstacles, acting in
accordance with its true nature The childish qualities
of which we catch glimpses are simply a part of life,
like the colours of birds or the scent of flowers , they

176
THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED

are not at all the results of any “method of education”.
But it is evident that these natural facts can be influ-
enced by an education seeking to protect them, cults
vate them, and assist their development. Even on
flowers, with their natural colours and scents, man can
exercise an influence by cultivation , he can ensure the
appearance of certain characters, and he can cause the
primary characters presented by nature to develop in
strength and beauty Now the phenomena presented
ina Casa det Bambini are natural psychological charac-
teristics, They are not apparent like the natural facts
of vegetable life, for psychic life 1s so fluid that its
characteristics may completely disappear mm an un-
favourable environment, to be replaced by equivalents
Therefore, before proceeding to educative develop-
ment, it is necessary to establish the conditions of an
environment that will favour the blooming of the nor-
mal, hidden characteristics To this end it 1s enough
to remove obstacles , this 1s the first step and the foun-
dation of educanon It 1s thus a question not merely
of developing existing characteristics, but first of dis~
covering their nature , only afterwards does it become
possible to foster normal development

If we study the first series of conditions, produced
by chance, and which led to a blooming of normal
characteristics, we ray note a few of especial impor-
tance. Ones the provision of a pleasant environment,
where the children felt no constramt Those children
who had come from wretched hovels must have found
their new environment very pleasant indeed—the clean,
white room, the new little tables, the new httle chairs

177
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

and armchairs, made on purpose for them, and the
little lawns of the sunny courtyard

Another condition was the negative role of the
adult—ilhterate parents, a working-class mistress with-
out the ambitions or prejudices of a real school teacher
Here was a situation that might be considered as one
of “intellectual calm” It has always been recoguised
that a teacher must be calm, but the calm demanded
was one of character and nerves Here was a deeper
calm , a state of emptmess or better of freedom from
mental lumber, producmg an inner translucency, a
freedom from itellectual attachment Such a state
approaches the intellectual purity that St Francis of
Assisi felt, and which was confused with ignorance,
whereas 1t was a mental state predisposmg to that
uluminatve state open to divine enlightenment. Sum-
Jar to this 1s the spiritual humility which prepares us to
understand the child, and which should, therefore, be
the most essential part of a teacher’s preparation

Another notable circumstance was the provision of
suitable and alluring scientific matenal for the children,
perfected with a view to education of the senses, with
such things as the lacmg frames, which allowed an
analysis and refinement of movements All these
were such as to awaken concentrated attention This
could never have come about if someone like a teacher
teaching by word of mouth had called forth their ener-
gies from the outside

So far we have a suitable environment, humility
the teacher, and scientific maternal Here are the three
external features of the method

178
THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED

Let us now seek to discover some of the manifes-
tations on the part of the children

The most pertinent, which seemed hike a magic
touch opemmg the gates to an expansion of normal
characteristics, is a consistent activity concentrated on
a smgle work, an exercise on some external object,
when the movements of the hands are guided by the
mind And here we find the unfolding of charac-
teristics which plamnly come from an mner impulse,
like the “repetition of the exercise” and “free choice
of objects” It is then that the true child appears,
aglow with joy, indefatigable because his activity 1s
like the psychic metabolism to which life and hence
development is attached From now on it is his own
choice that guides him He responds eagerly to cer-
tain tests, hke that of silence; he delights m certain
lessons which open a way of justice and dignity before
lum He avidly assimilates the means that enable him
to develop his mund Whereas he turns from other
things, such as prizes, sweets, and toys Moreover he
shows us that order and discipline are vital needs and
vital expression where he is concerned And all the
while he 1s a real child, fresh, sincere, gay, lively, shout~
ing when his enthusiasm overflows, applauding, run-
ning, greeting loudly, thanking with effusion, calling
and running after one in sign of gratitude He approa~
ches all, admures everything, adapts himself to every-
thing

Let us choose out, then, the things that he has
chosen, and let us take into account his spontaneous
manifestations in order to make a kind of list And

179
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

at the same time let us note the things he has rejected,
lsting them, to avoid wasting time, as things abolished

The first hst shows us Individual work Repetition
of the exercise Free choice Control by error
Analysts of movements Silence exercises Good
manners in social contacts Order m the environ-
ment Meticulous personal cleanlmess Sense edu-
cation Wnitng isolated from reading Wmtng pnor
to readmg Reading without books Discipline m
free achvity

And then the second list Abolition of rewards and
punishments Abohtion of ABC Abolition of col-
lective lessons Abolition of Programmes and ex-
aminations Abohtion of toys and Greedmess Aboli-
tion of a special high desk for the teacher

Undoubtedly, in this double hist we find the outhne
of an educational method In short, practical and
positive, or rather experimental guiding lines have
been provided by the child humself for the construction
of a method of education, in which his choice guides
xts shapmg and his vital eagerness acts as control of
error

It 1s indeed marvellous to realise that in the sub-
sequent building up of a real method of education,
worked out by the expenences of a long penod these
early principles that came from nothmg have remained
intact. It makes one think of the embryo of a verte-
brate, mm which a hne appears that is known as the
primitive hne it 1s a real design without substance,
which will later become the vertebral column We
may carry the comparison further In the vertebrate

180
THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED

we see the whole divided into three parts—head, thora-
cic section, abdominal section , then a number of poimts
that little by little follow an ordered evolution and end
by solidifying—the vertebrae Thus m the primary
outline of our educational method there 1s a whole, a
basic line on which three essential factors stand out—
the environment, the teacher, and the apparatus, with
a number of special features that evolve httle by little,
lke the vertebrae

It would be interesting to follow this elaboration
step by step, the first work in human society guided
by the child, showing the evolution of those principles
that presented themselves at first as unsuspected re-
velations. Evolution is the best term to indicate the
successive developments of this singular method, for
new details were produced by life as it evolved at the
expense of its environment This environment, how-
ever, 1s a special one, for it too, through the work of
the adult, 1s an active and vital response to the new
patterns revealed by the evolution of child life

The extraordmanly rapid spread of attempts to
apply this method to schools for children of every
social condition and even of every race, has widened
our experience, enabling us to note beyond all question
the existence of constant features, of universal tenden-
cies, and thus, we may say, of natural laws which should
form the first bases of education.

The schools that followed the first Casa der Bambini
are especially interesting through the fact they were
inspired by the same principle of awaiting the children’s

181
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

spontaneous manifestations, before an external
paration of definite methods had been established

MESSINA ORPHANS

An impressive and mdeed celebrated example
obtamed im one of the first Casa det Bambini
founded n Rome The circumstances were still
unusual than in the case of the first school, be
here were orphans who had survived one of the ;
est catastrophes, the Messina earthquake, sixty
children discovered among the rums No one
either their names or their social status This te
shock had reduced them to umformity, they
numbed, silent, absent-mmded It was har

and napkins, and even cakes of soap and towels
all in proportion to small hands that would take

MESSINA ORPHANS

there were ponds of gold-fish and dove-cots In this
settmg the nuns, in their light-coloured habits, mayes-
tie in their long veils, moved in calm and silence

They taught the children good manners, with in-
creasing insistence on detail Many came from the
anstocracy, and these put into practice the most meti-
culous usages of the society fe they had left, search-
ing in memory and early habits for any details they
could recall, for the children seemed msatiable They
learned to behave at table ke princes, and they also
learned to wait at table like the best waiters The
dinner that no longer attracted them as food attracted
them through a spirit of exactitude, as an exercise in
controlled movements, through upliftmg facts of
knowledge, and little by little the children also re
gamed the hearty appetites natural to their age, to-
gether with tranquil sleep The change in them was
really umpressive. You saw them running and jump-
ing, as they carried things into the garden, moving all
the furniture of a room to put it in a little square un-
der the trees, without breaking anything or knocking
into anything, their faces alert and joyous It was
here that the term “conversion” was first applied
“These children seem to me as if they had experienced
conversion”, said a Jady who was one of the most
distinguished Itahan authoresses of the time, “there
is no conversion more miraculous than that which
vanquishes melancholy and depression, and brings an
entry to a higher plane of hfe” Thus idea, which gave
a spiritual form to the mexplicable and impressive phe-
nomena that none could fail to recognise, stirred many

183

7
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

unds, and the term remamed m vogue for a long
ime i spite of its paradoxical sense For the idea
of conversion seems contrary to the state of innocence
of childhood, But here was a spimtnal change, by
which they were bberated from sorrow and abandon-
ment and reborn to joy Sadness and sm are both
conditions that indicate a remoteness from the fount
of vital energies, and under this aspect to be able to
rediscover such vital energies 1s to be converted
Then sadness and sin disappear hike the night, and the
day dawns im joy and punfication Indeed the two
things are umphed among the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
He 1s called “highest Comforter”, “sweet refreshment,”
“rest 11 Jabour”, “comfort mm weeping” He purges
what 1s ugly, waters what 1s dry, heals what 1s woun-
ded, bends what 1s ngid, straightens the crooked, and
gives health and perpetual joy There 1s nothing m
man without His aid, nothmg without Him that 1s
not harmful,

Truly, this was what was happenmg to our children.
There was a resurrection from sadness to joy, with the
disappearance of many faults that are usually consi-
dered mcorngible, but there was something more—
the disappearance also of charactenstics that are
usually looked upon as ments, Here indeed the
children brought a dazzhng enhghtenment, Nihil
est mnoxum! Everything m man is mistaken and

everything must be made new. And for this remak~-
ing there 1s only one way—a return to the sole source
of creative energies. Without this complex demons-
tration in the children who came to our schools from
the most abnormal conditions of life 1t would not have
been possible to distinguish good and evil in the
characters of children, for previously the adult had
made up lis own mind that the child was good m so
far as he adapted himself to the adult’s conditions of
life, and vice versa, Through these opposing judg-
ments the natural characteristics of the child had re-
mamed buned. The real child had disappeared ; he

was an unknown in the adult world; good and evil
kept him burned alike.

WELL-TO-DO CHILDREN

Another class of children who live in abnormal
social conditions is that of the children of the rich.
One would imagine they would be much easier to
educate than the very poor children of the first school,
or the orphans from the Messina earthquake. In

"TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

what, indeed, could thew conversion consist? Rich
children are privileged children, surrounded by every
care society can provide But to clear up this pre-
judice I will quote a few pages from an old book of
mune, in which teachers who worked in our schools in
Europe and America give a sincere account of ther
first impressions and the difficulties they encountered,
making one think of the words of St. Francis when he
extols humble thng “Draw near, Sister Grasshop-
per, 2t 15 mm the smallest creatures that the goodness
of the Creator 1s best revealed ”

Beauty m bis environment, a wealth of flowers, do
not attract the mich child The garden paths do not
allure him The correspondence between child and
apparatus 1s not reached, The teacher is disonented
by the fact that the children do not fling themselves, as
she will have hoped, on the objects she presents,
choosing among them as their preferences duect. In
schools for poor children this nearly always happens
from the very first. But mch children, already satia-
ted with objects of every kind and with magnificent
toys, rarely feel an attraction to the stimul: presented
to them

An Amencan teacher, Miss G, wrote from Wash-
ington “The children snatched the apparatus from
each other , if I tried to show something to one child,
the others dropped what they were domg and noisily,
without any purpose, gathered round me When I
had fimshed explaining an apparatus, all crowded
round it and fought for st, The children showed no
interest in the apparatus They passed from one

186
WELL-TO-DO CHILDREN

thing to another without persistmg m any. There
was a child so incapable of keeping still that he could
not sit down long enough to pass his fingers over one
of the small objects we give to the children. In many
cases the movements of the children held no purpose.
They ran round the room without any end m mind
In moving they took no care to respect things , they
ran into the table, upset the chairs, and walked on the
apparatus Sometimes they began to work at some-
thing in one place, then ran somewhere else, picked up
another object, only to leave it”

Mile D. wrote from Pans~ “I must confess that
my experiences were really discouraging The chil-
dren could not concentrate on any work for more
than a minute They had no perseverance, and no
imitative Often they just copied one another hke a
flock of lambs. When a child picked up an object,
all the others wanted to imitate. Sometimes they
rolled on the ground and upset the chairs”

From a school for rich children in Rome comes the
followmg laconic descripnon. “The chief concern
is disciphne The children are disonented in their
work, and refractory to guidance”

Here now are some descnptons of the advent of
discrphne, Miss G gave the followmg account of her
experiences in Washmgton “In a few days that
nebulous mass of whirling particles (the disorderly
children) began to assume a defimte shape The
children seemed to begin to find their own orientation ;
they began to take an original interest in many objects
that they had begun by despising as silly toys, and as

187
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

a result of this new interest they began to act as inde-
pendent individuals, very highly individualised It
then came about that an object absorbing the whole
attention of one child had not the smallest attraction
for another , the children divided from each other nm
their manifestations of attention.

The battle 1s really won only when the child dis-
covers something, some particular object, which
arouses in hum a deep and spontaneous interest Some-
times this enthusiasm 1s born suddenly, with strange
rapidity I had once tried in vain to interest a child
showing him every piece of apparatus, without arous-
ing a spark of attention Then, by chance, I showed
hum two red and blue tablets, calling his attention to
the difference of colour He took them at once with
a kind of hunger and learned five colours im one lesson
In the following days he took all the pieces of appara-
tus which he had at first scorned, and httle by little
became interested in all.

“A child who had at first very slight power of con-
centration found a way out of this state of chaos
through becoming interested in one of the most com-
plicated pieces of apparatus, the so-called lengths He
played with them contmnuously for a week on end,
and learned to count and to do simple additions Then
he began to work backwards, the simpler objects, the
cylinders, the metal insets, and came to take mterest
in every part of the system.

“No sooner do the children find the objects that
iterest them than disorder disappears in a flash and
the wandenngs of ther minds are at an end”

188
WELL-TO-DO CHILDREN

The same teacher describes an awakening of per-
sonality. “There were two sisters, one of three and
the other of five. The child of three did not exist
as an individuality at all, for she copied her elder sister
exactly in everything. If her sister had a blue pencil,
the little one would not rest content till she had a
blue one too, if her sister ate bread and butter and
she had something different, she would insist on bread
and butter and so on. This little girl showed no in-
terest in anything in the school but simply imutated
her elder sister m everything she did One day the
little one became interested in the pmk bricks She
built her tower, and her interest became very keen
She repeated the exercise many times and completely
forgot her sister. The elder sister was so surprised
that she called her and said: ‘How 1s it 'm doing a
Cucle and you're building the tower?’ From that day
forth the little one showed a personabty of her own
and began to develop on her own She was no longer
just the murror of her sister”

Mile D. speaks of a little gurl of four who was
absolutely incapable of carrymg a glass of water,
even though it were only half full, without spilling it,
so much so that she avoided attempting it in the
knowledge that she could not do it She developed
an iterest in an exercise of another kind with one of
the apparatus, and after that she began to carry glasses
of water with the greatest of ease And since some
of her school-fellows were paintng im water-colour,
it became a craze with her to carry water to all, with-
out spilling a drop. Another really curious fact was

189
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

reported by an Australian teacher, Miss B She hac
in her school a little girl who had not yet develope:
the power of speech, and who uttered only marticu
late sounds, so that her parents had bad her medhcall
examined to find out if she were abnormal. Thi
little gurl one day took an interest in the solid cyhn
ders, spending a long tme working with them, pulhn,
the little wooden pegs out of their holes and puthn,
them in again. Astd after she had repeated her tasi
a great many times with the keenest interest, she ran
to the teacher saying, “Come and look !”

Miss B tells of the children’s yoy m their work
“The children showed the pride we feel when we have
produced something really new by ourselves They
danced about and threw thew arms round my neck
when they had learned to do somethmng very simple,
and they told me ‘I’ve done it all myself You did-
n’t think that I could do this, did you? And to-day
I've done it better than yesterday’ ”

Mile D says “After the Chnstmas holidays,
there was a great change in the class It seemed that
order established itself without any mtervention of
mime The children seemed too busy with their work
for the disorderly actions they had engaged im before
They went by themselves to the cupboard to choose
the objects that had earlier seemed boring to them, and
they took them one after another, without showmg
any sign of tiredness An atmosphere of work spread
through the class The children who tll then had
taken up objects only through the whim of moment,
felt now, as it were, the need for a kind of rule, for

190
TRUE NORMALITY

a personal, inner rule , they concentrated their efforts
on accurate and methodical tasks, feelng a real sat-
isfaction im overcommg difficultes. This accurate
work produced an unmediate result on thei characters.
They became their own masters”

The example that most struck Mile. D. was that
of a little boy of four and a half, who had an extremely
vivid mmagination, so much so that when he was given
an object he did not observe its shape but personified
1, and at the same time personified himself, talking
continually, mmaginmg humself someone else, and it
was impossible to make him fia his attention on the
objects themselves. While his mind was thus dis-
tracted he was incapable of any precise action, such
as doing up even one button. All at once something
marvellous began to work in him “I saw,” she says,
“with amazement how a remarkable change came over
tum He took one of the exercises as hus favounte
occupation, and afterwards passed on to all the others.
And thus he became calm ”

TRUE NORMALITY

These old, authentic descriptions by teachers who
opened schools before a sure method had been estab-
lshed, could be repeated almost ad infirmture, always
the same Similar incidents and similar difficulties,
though in a lesser degree, are to be found with nearly
all happy children who have intelligent and loving
families to look after them. There are spintual diffi-
culues bound up with what we call prospenty, and
which explain how the famous words of the Sermon

191 -
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

on the Mount find an echo im every heart “Blessed
are the poor im spirit, blessed are they that weep” ,

But all are called, all are able to respond, over-
coming their particular difficulties Hence the phe-
nomenon that was called “conversion” 1s proper to
childhood It implies a swift, sometimes instantane-
ous change, brought about always by the same cause
It would not be possible to quote a single example
of conversion that did not involve the concentration
of activity on an interesting task And the conver-
sions that thus come about are of widely differing
kinds Children of excited fantasy become calm, de-
pressed children rise up, and all advance together, on
the same road of work and discipline, continuing 2
progress which evolves of itself, moved by some inner
energy that, having found a way of egress, can dis-
play itself in outward act

There is an explosive character in facts that anse
suddenly, as sure heralds of a development that will
follow after It is the same as when one day, of a
sudden, a tooth appears, just as of a sudden the baby
utters his first word, or takes his first step When
the first tooth has appeared, the whole set of teeth
will follow , after the first word, speech develops, after
the first step, the art of walking is permanently
acquired Thus development had been arrested, or
rather, had been turned into a wrong direction, in all
children, m children of every social condition. The
spread of our schools over the world, among every
race, will prove this child conversion to be a general
fact, common to all mankind It will be possible to

192
TRUE NORMALITY

make a meticulous study of an innumerable quantity
of charactenstics that fade away, to be replaced al-
ways by the same structure of life Thus at the ong
of fe, in the small baby, errors are constantly being
made, deformmg the natural psychological type of
man, and leading to an infinity of deviations.
_ The singular fact that we note im child conversions
is a psychological cure, a return to normal condrtions.
The child who seems miraculous m his precocious
intelligence, the hero who overcomes bumself and his
own grief, finding strength to live and new serenity,
the rich child who prefers discrphned work to frivoli-
ues of life, are normal children And that which was
called conversion when it imphed only the emergence
of a surprising fact, must, after the finding of wide
expenence, be reckoned a normalisation. There was
a hidden nature in man, a nature buried and, there-
fore, unknown, which none the less is sumply bus true
Sature, the nature given by creation, health

This mterpretation does not cancel the features of
Conversion ; perhaps even the adult can be summoned
back to what he should be, but this 1s so difficult that
Such a change could not be considered a mere return
to human nature Whereas in the child the normal
Psychic characteristics can easily emerge, and then all
the conditions that were deviations from the norm
disappear together, just as with restored health all the
Symptoms of illness vanish. If we observe children
im the Light of this understanding, we should very
often be able to recognise spontaneous emergeuces of
Uormality even where the conditions of environment

193
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

are unfavourable And, though driven under be-
cause unrecognised and unassisted, they return, as
vital energies that make a place for themselves in the
midst of obstacles, seeking to prevail It mught be
said that the normal energies of the child teach us
a lesson of forgiveness, as m the words of Chnst,
“Thou shalt not forgive seven times, but seventy times
seven” Thus the deeper nature of the child retums
to the surface not seven times but seventy tumes seven,
however it be repressed by the adult. It 1s, therefore,
not a transitory episode of mfant hfe that engulfs the
characteristics of normality, but a struggle due to con-
finuous repression

CHAPTER IV
PSYCHIC DEVIATIONS
THEIR SINGLE CAUSE

OpseRVING the features that disappear with normal-
asation, we find to our surprise that these embrace
nearly the whole of what are considered as character-
istics of childhood. Not only untidiness, disobedi-
ence, laziness, greediness, selfishness, quarreling,
naughtiness, but also the so-called creative umagina-
tion, delight im stones, affectionate attachment to
persons, submussiveness, play, etc Even the fea-
tures that have been scientifically studied as proper
to childhood, such as smtation, cunosity, inconstancy,
instability of attention disappeasr And this means
that the nature of the child, as hitherto known, 1s a

194
THEIR SINGLE CAUSE

mere semblance masking an original and normal na-
ture Here is a fact the more stmking in that it is
universal, but it is nothmg new From earliest anti-
quity it has been recognised that there are two natures
in man—man as he was created, and man as fallen,
the fall bemg attributed to an original error affecting
all mankind: onginal sm. It has also been recog-
nised that this sin in itself 1s trivial, out of all propor-
tion to the ummensity of its consequences, but umply-
ing a forsaking of the creative spint, of the laws laid
down in creation After 1t man becomes hke a dnif-
ting ship, driven by chance, with no defence against
the obstacles of his environment or against the dlustons
of his mind Hence he 1s lost This conception, a
synthesis of the philosophy of life, finds a smgular and
ilummating counterpart im the life of the child A
very trivial thing leads to deviation, something hidden
and tenuous that creeps in under the guise of love and
help, but which at bottom comes from a blindness in
the adult soul, a veiled and unconscious egotism, that
1s really a diabolical power working against the child.
But the child is continually reborn, fresh and un-
spoiled, bearing in himself intact the pattern which
should determine the development of the man.

Tf normalisation comes about through a determined
and single fact, viz., the concentration on some acti-
vity of movement, which brings the child into relation
with external reality, we must suppose that a single

. fact les at the source of all deviations, viz., : that the
child has been prevented from fulfillmg the onmginal
pattern of hus development, through some action affec-

"195
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

ting his environment at the formative age, when his
potential energies should evolve through a process of
incarnation

If we are thus able to reduce a host of consequen-
ces to a single, clear and simple cause, it proves that
the fact from which they derive must belong to a pri-
mary penod of hfe, when man 1s still a spiritual em-
bryo, then this single, imperceptible cause may lead
to distortion of the whole being

FUGUES

As a guide m interpreting the characteristics resul-
tung from deviation, we may, therefore, take the idea
of incarnation—of a psychic energy that must achieve
mcarnanon through movement, thus welding the
acting personality into unity If this unity cannot be
achieved, through the substitution of the adult for
the child or through a want of motives of activity 0
lus environment, two things happen psychic energy
and movement must develop separately, and a “divi-
ded man” results Since in nature nothing creates itself
and nothing destroys itself, and this 1s especially true
in the case of energies, these energies, since they have
to work outside the scope assigned to them by nature,
become deviated. They are deviated above all be-
cause they have lost their object and work mm empt-
ness, vagueness and chaos The mind that should
have built itself up through experiences of movement,
flees wto fantasy Such fuginve mmds began by
seeking and not finding, they wished to attach them-
selves to things and could not, and thus they wander

196
FUGUES

among images and symbols. As for movement, these
lively children are never still, but ther movements
are disordered, without purpose. They begin an
action only to leave it unfinished, for their energy
passes through things without becoming attached to
any. The adult, even while he punishes the unregu-
lated and disturbing actions of such sturdy, restless
children, or while he bears them by exercise of pati-
ence, none the less admures and encourages their fan-
cies, interpreting them as imagination, as the creative
fecundity of the child mind. It is well known that
many of Froebel’s games and pastimes are intended
to encourage the development of such symbolism He
helps the child to pretend that his blocks and bricks
vanously assembled are horses or castles or kings’
thrones. Indeed the child’s tendency to symbolism
leads him to use any object as though it were an elec-
tric switch illuminatng the fantastic mirages of his
mind. A stick is a horse, a chair a throne, a pencil
an aeroplane. That 1s why children are given toys,
which do not allow them to exercise any real activity,
but provide them with ideas and illusions. They are
merely imperfect and unproductive images of reality.
Toys, in fact, seem to present a useless environment
which cannot lead to any concentration of the spirit
and which has no purpose ; they are for minds astray
in illusion. Toys immediately stir children to activity,
like an animating breath that brings to flame a glow~
ing coal hidden under ashes, But almost at once
the flame goes out and the toy is thrown away. And
yet toys are the only things that the adult has made

197
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

for the child as an intelligent bemg, im the endeavour
to provide him with material on which his activity
can be freely exercised The adult m fact leaves the
child free only mm his games, or better, only with his
toys, in the conviction that these form a world in which
he will be happy This conviction has persisted, even
though the child soon tres of his toys and so often
breaks them, but here the adult has shown himself
generous and liberal, and the gift of toys becomes a
ritual It 1s the only freedom that the adult world
has allowed to man in the venerable age of infancy,
at a time when he should be setting the roots of a
Ingher hfe Such “divided” children are considered
very intelligent, especially at school, but undisciplin-
ed and untidy But in our specially prepared envi-
ronments we see them all at once fix themselves upon
some task, and then their excited fantasies and their
restless movements disappear together , a calm, serene
child, attached to reality, begins to work out his ele-
vation through work Normalisation has been
achieved His organs of movement have emerged
from chaos in the moment in which they were able
to attach themselves to their mward guide , hence-
forth they will become the mstruments of an intell-
gence hungry to know and to penetrate the reality
of the outer world And thus wandering cunosity 1s
transformed ito an effort to master knowledge
Psycho-analysis has recogmsed the abnormal side
of imagination and play, and by a luminous imterpre-
tation has registered them among “psychological
fugues” A fugue is a running away, a taking refuge

“198
“BARRIERS”

and often hiding away of an energy that 1s out of its
natural place ; or else it represents a subconscious de-
fence of the ego, which flies from discomfort or dan-
ger and hides itself behind a mask

“BARRIERS”

In school, teachers notice that highly imaginative
children are not the ones that succeed in gaiming the
most profit from their studies, as might have been ex-
pected. Indeed they seem sometumes to gam no
profit at all Yet no one suspects that there has been
a deviation of their intelligence ; it is belteved that a
great creative mtelligence cannot apply itself to prac-
tical things. Here is one of the plamest signs that
the deviated child has a dimumshed mtelligence, for
he does not possess his mund nor can he lead it towards
its full development. This happens not only where
the mond has taken refuge in a world of dlusion, but also
im many other cases in which, on the contrary, intelli-
gence has been more or less suppressed and quenched
in discouragement—where instead of fleeing without,
it has withdrawn itself within The average intelli-
gence level of ordinary children is low compared with
that of normalised children This comes about through
deviations that might be compared, roughly, to dislo~
cated bones, out of place, and hence requirmg most
delicate care of there 1s to be a return to normality.
Whereas the usual method is one of direct aggression,
both in intellectual teaching and in correction of dis-
order. It 1s impossible to constrain a deviated intelli-
gence to forced labour, without encountering or rather

199
13
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD’

provoking a defence that as a psychological phenome-
non is most mnterestng It 1s not the defence that 1s
by now well known to psychology in general, and which
shows itself outwardly as disobedience or obstinacy.
It 1s on the contrary a psychic defence wholly outside
the domain of the will, and it represents a subconscious
impediment to the reception, and hence to the compre-
hension, of ideas imposed from without. It 1s akin to
the phenomenon to which psycho-analysts have given
the descriptive name of inhibitions The teacher should
tecognise these grave facts A land of curtain comes
down over the child’s mind, making him psychologi-
cally still more deaf and bind It 1s as though the
subconscious mind were to say “You speak, but I
am not listening , you repeat things, but I do not hear
you Icannot build up my world because I am build-
ing up a wall of defence so that you cannot come in!”

This slow, prolonged work of defence leads a child
to act as though he had lost hus natural powers, and
here it 1s no longer a question of willingness or un-
willingness The teacher who has to do with pupils
m whom such barners exist will think them ummntell-
gent, or naturally sncapable of understanding certain
subjects, such as, for instance, mathematics, or of
correcting thew spelling mistakes If such psychic
barniers cover many subjects, or as sometimes happens,
all subjects, mtelligent children may be confused with
defecuves, and after remammg mm the same class for
several years may be definitely relegated among the
backward children As a rule the psychic barner 1s
not only an unpenetrability ; but carries with it co-

200
“BARRIERS”

efficients that work at a distance Thus we find re-
pugnance to a special subject, then repugnance to
study in general, to the school, the teacher, the other
children There 1s no more room for love or cordia-
lity, tl the child comes to be afraid of school, and
then he 1s wholly cut off

Nothing 1s more common than for mdividuals to
carry psychic resistances set up im infancy through-
out their lives. We find an example in the typical
repugnance to mathematics that many feel all ther
lives. It 1s not only an mcapacity to understand, but
the mere name sets up an inner obstacle that brings
wearmess before activity can even begin The same
thing happens with grammar. I once knew a very
mtelligent Italian gul who made spelling mistakes that
were really mcredibie in anyone of her age and cul-
ture All efforts to correct her were in vain, her mis-
takes seemed to icrease, and even reading the classics
did no good But one day to my amazement I saw
her wnte in correct and pure Itahan JI cannot treat
of her case here, but what 1s certain is that the form
of expression existed, but an occult force tyrannically
held it under, sending forth mstead a shower of mus-
takes

It may be asked which of the two forms of devia-
tion, fugues or psychic barriers, 1s the most serious
In our normalising schools fugues lke those we have
quoted affecting imagination and play have been
easiest to cure. This may be illustrated by the fol-
lowing analogy If someone flees from a place be-
cause he has not found there the thmgs he needed or

201
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

if a whole people flees in general exodus because a
country does not provide the necessary food, we can
always conceive of ther beimg summoned back if con-
ditions of environment are changed. We can cry to
them “Come back. We will provide better condi-
tions for your lives You will be able to use your
energies in a pleasant environment.”

In fact one of the things we have often noticed in
our schools is the rapidity of transformation in dis-
orderly and violent children, who seem in a flash to
come back from a distant world The change mm them
1s not only the outwardly apparent transformation of
disorder into work, but 1t es deeper, and shows itself
as serenity and content. The disappearance of their
deviations comes about as a spontaneous event, a
natural transformation, and yet had such dewation
not been rectified in childhood, 1t would have remain-
ed throughout hfe In fact, many adults who are con-
sidered mchly endowed with umagimation have really
only vague feelings towards their environment and
make contact only with sensory realities They are
those who are said to be temperamentally imagina-
tive, they are untidy, and always ready to admure
lights, the sky, colours, flowers, landscapes, music ,
they are sensible to thmgs of fe as to a novel But
they do not love the ght they admire, they would be
incapable of stoppmg to learn about it , the stars that
mspue them could not hold thew attention long
enough for them to acquire the smallest knowledge
of astronomy They have artistic tendencies, but
bring forth no artistic productions, for they are w-

202
“BARRIERS”

capable of gaming any real technical proficiency As
a rule they do not know what to do with thew hands
They cannot keep them still, nor use them
They touch things nervously, and are lable to break
them They will distractedly tear to pieces the flower
they so much admired. They cannot create anything
beautiful, they cannot make their lives happy, they
do not know how to find the real poetry of the world
They are lost, if no one saves them, for they mistake
their orgame weakness and incapacity for a higher
state Now the ongin of this state, which predis-
Poses them to real psychological diseases, lay at the
Toots of their life, at the age when confusion was easi-
est and when a barred road led to deviations at first
amperceptible

Psychic imbhibitions, on the other hand, are far
harder to overcome, even in small children They
form an mner wall that shuts in the spit, hiding it
to defend it from the world A secret drama is taking
place behind those manifold barners, which are often
a defence against all that 1s beautiful outside and that
would be a source of riches and happiness Study the
secrets of science and mathematics, the fascinating re-
finements of an immortal tongue, music, all are hence-
forth the “enemy” from whom it is necessary to find
isolazon This strange transformation of energy pro-
jects a darkness that covers and hides what should be
an object of love and life Studies were a wearmess,
and Jed to an aversion to the world instead of to a
preparation to take part in it

Barners! This suggestive word by association of

203
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

ideas reminds us of all the defences man set up about
his body before a knowledge of physical hygiene showed
ium a healthier mode of hving Men defended them-
selves from sun, air, water, surroundmg themselves
with barners, building walls through which no hight
could pass, keeping ther windows shut mght and day,
while they were too small to let through sufficient
air, covermg themselves with heavy clothing, layer
upon layer, hke the wrappmgs of an onion, which
made the body reluctant to plunge itself mto water,
keepmg the pores of their skin closed agamst the puri-
fying aw The physical envionment of man was
barricaded against life

From the social standpoint, too, we see phenomena
that remmd us of barriers Why do men isolate
themselves one from the other, and why does every
family group shut itself up with a feeling of isolation
and of repugnance towards other groups? The
family does not isolate itself to find enjoyment in it-
self, but to separate itself from others These barn-
ers are not built to defend love The family barners
are closed, ssurmountable, more powerful than the
walls of the house So too are the barriers separat-
ing classes and nations National barriers are not
put up to separate off a united and uniform group, so
that it shall be free and secure from danger Anxiety
for isolation and defence remforces the barners
between nation and nation, and hinders the circulation
of individuals and of their produce Why, if civili-
sation comes about through exchange? Are na-
tional barriers too a psychological phenomenon, due

204
THE DEPENDENT CHILD

‘to some great suffering, the endurance of some ex-
treme violence? Pain has organised itself, and has
been so immense that ever stronger and thicker barri-
ers have crippled the ife of nations

THE DEPENDENT CHILD

There are certam submissive children whose psy-
chic energies are not strong enough to find a refuge
in flight, and who therefore, attach themselves to an
adult who tends to replace their activities by his own ,
such children become extremely dependent on the
adult The want of vital activity, though they are
unconscious of it, sets them whining. These are the
children who are always grumbling; they seem un-
happy and they are taken for creatures with very de-
licate feelings and sensitive to affection, They are
always bored without knowing it, and they have re-
course to others, to grown-ups, because by themselves
they are unable to throw off the depression of bore-
dom They attach themselves to someone, as though
their vitality depended on others They ask the
grown-up to help them, to play with them, to tell them
stones, sing to them, and beg him not to leave them
With such a child, the adult becomes a slave , a strange
reciprocity holds bath down, but the impression they
give 1s one of mutual understanding and intense affec-
tion These are the children who are asking why,
with question after question, as though they hungered
for knowledge. But if you observe them carefully
you perceive that they have not listened to an answer
before they have put another question What appears

205
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

as curiosity to know 1s really a means of binding the
person whom they need to sustain them They are
ready to renounce ther movements and obey every
imhibitmg command on the part of the adult, who
finds it very easy to substitute his own will for that
of the child, the child docilely giving way m every-
thmg Thus there is a grave danger of the child’s
fallmg mto apathy, that apathy that 1s called idleness
and sloth The adult welcomes such a state of things,
because it does not impede his own activities, but it
is really the extreme lmit to which deviation can
reach What 1s sloth but a depression of the spim-
tual organism? It corresponds to the failmg of phy-
sical strength in someone stricken with a grave ulness,
it 1s the depression of the vital and creative psycholo-
gical energies The Chmistian religion recognises
sloth among the seven deadly sins, that 1s, as bringing
danger of death to the soul The adult has driven
the child’s soul mto itself, he has breathed over 1t
his useless assistance, his substitution of his own acti-
vity, his suggestive power, and he has quenched it
And yet he perceives nothing

POSSESSIVENESS

In the very tiny child and im the normalised child
there 1s an urge that leads them towards forces in
order to act with them This outward movement
towards their environment is not something cold, but
a penetrating love, a vital sign comparable to hunger
In a hungry person there 1s an urge to seek food It
1s not associated with logical reasoning He does

206
POSSESSIVENESS

not say “It is a long tume since I last ate , without
eaung I cannot maimtam my strength or hive, it 1s
therefore necessary that I should look for nourshing
substances and eat them” Hunger is a discomfort
that brings an irresistible urge towards food And
the child has a kind of hunger that carmes him to-
wards his surroundings, to seek for thmgs that can
feed his spint, nourishing himself by activity “As
children newly born, let us love spiritual milk” In
this impulse, that is, in love of his environment, lies
the basic characteristic of men It would not be cor-
rect to say that the child has a passion for his environ-
ment, for passion implies something impulsive and
transitory , 1t implies the urge to a “vital episode ”
The impetus provided by a child’s love of bis en-
vironment leads hum instead to a constant activity, a
continual fire, luke the contmual burning of the ele-
ments of the body in contact with oxygen, giving the
gentle heat natural to the living body The active
child expresses himself as a creature that must hve
by the means he has, the means without which he can-
not fulfil himself.

If the child is demed this environment of psychic
life, everything mm him 1s weakened, deviated and shut
away He becomes an impenetrable, enigmatic being,
empty, incapable, naughty, bored, cut off from society.

Now if it 1s rendered impossible for the child to
find the motives of activity that would develop lum,
he sees only “things,” and wants to possess them To
take, to possess, here 1s something easy, where inte-
Hectual hfe and love are useless Energy bursts forth

207
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

im another direction “I want,” says the child, seeing
a gold watch on which he cannot tell the tme
“No, me!” cries another, ready to break it and there-
fore to render 1t useless, yet eager to possess 1t. And
thus begin competition and destructive struggles

Almost all moral deviations are consequences of
this first step that decides between love and possession,
and which may set the child on one of two diverging
paths, carrying him forward with the full force of hfe
The active part of the child projects 1tself outward
like the tentacles of an octopus, to crush and destroy
things he passionately clasps Feelings of ownership
make hum vehemently attached to things and ready
to defend them as he would defend himself

Sturdier, active children defend their things even
by fightmg agaist other children who feel a like
desire to possess them They are continually quat-
relling, because they want the same thing or because
they want something another has Here 1s the ongin
of reactions anything but loving, of an explosion of
feelmgs anything but fraternal, leading to struggle and
war about somethmg of no importance whatever
But it 1s not really of no umportance, but very grave
There has been a displacement, an obscuration of
something that should have existed, an energy has
been deviated It 1s thus an immer evil and not the
thing 1m itself that causes possessiveness

As everyone knows, attempts are made to give a
‘and of moral training by means of exhortations,
order that the child should not become thus attached
to external things The foundation of such teachmg

208
POSSESSIVENESS

1s sespect of the property of others, But when the
child Mas reached thes pomt, he has already crossed
the bridge by which man has separated humself from
the grandeur of his mner fe, and that 1s why he
tums with desire to outward things The germ has
filtered into the child soul so deeply that such charac-
teristics are yudged proper to human nature

Even children of submissive character turn thew
interest to outward material things of no value Such
children, however, have a different way of “possess-
ing” which 1s not quarrelsome and as a rule does not
lead them to competitive struggles They tend rather
to accumulate and hide things, so that people believe
them natural collectors. But it is very different from
collecting and classifying things under the guidance
of a certam knowledge We are speaking instead of
children who accumulate the most varied and unre-
lated objects, which in themselves offer no attraction
Pathology recognises cases of an empty and logical
collecting that is a sign of madness, that 1s, dictated
by a psychological anomaly, and this to be found not
only in mentally diseased men, but also i delinquent
children whose pockets are often crammed with use-
less and il-assorted objects There 1s a likeness be-
tween this and the collecting mstinct of children of
weak, submissive character, which 1s generally looked’
upon as quite normal If someone takes away the
things they have accumulated, such children seek to
defend themselves as far as they are able. Adler, as
psychologist, has given an interesting interpretation of
such symptoms He compares them to avarice, to

209
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the phenomenon to be found im the adult of whick
the germ can be recognised in infancy It 1s the phe-
nomenon through which a man 1s attached to many
things and does not want to give them up even if they
are of no use to him, a poisonous plant which has
grown up as a result of a fundamental Jack of balance

Parents are pleased when thew children defend
their property , m this they see human nature and re-
cognise a link with social life Even the children who
hoard and accumulate are human figures comprehen-
sible m society

THE POWER CRAVING

Another characteristic deviation associated with
possession 1s the wish for power There 1s a power
mstinchive m one who is master of his environment
which leads him through love of that environment to
possess himself of the outer world But it 1s a devia-
tion when power, instead of bemg a fruit of conquest,
buildmg up human personality, 1s directed to seizng
and snatching at things

Now the deviated child 1s confronted by an adult
who 1s for him a supremely powerful bemg with all
things at lus disposal The child understands that
his own power would be great indeed if he could act
through the adult Thus he begms to exploit the
adult to obtain from him what he could never obtain
in ins own sphere This process 1s perfectly under-
standable It shows itself mevitably in all children,
so much so that it 1s considered one of the commonest
facts and one of those hardest to correct It provides

THE POWER CRAVING

the typical example of baby naughtiness, for it is lo-
gical and natural that a weak, mcapable, umprisoned
creature, once he has made the wonderful discovery
that he can persuade a’ powerful, free being to pro-
cure advantages for him, should seek to obtain such
advantages. The child makes the tral and begins to
want things, and to want things over and above what
the adult considers logically mght for hm. For his
wants are boundless The child 1s full of fancies, and
the adult seems to be an ommpotent bemg who can
fulfil the deswes of Ins dreams in all their dazzling
splendour Such a feebng finds full realisation im
fauy stones, which, while they have often a profound
spinitual sigmficance, may often appear as romances
of the child soul In the latter form of fatry stores
children feel their obscure wishes exalted in attrac-
tive gmse Whoever asks the fairies can obtain
favours, riches far beyond any human power There
are good and bad fairies, beauiful and ugly ones They
May appear in the guise of poor people or mch people
Some live in the woods, some in enchanted palaces
‘They seem indeed the idealised. projection of the child
who lives among adults There are old faines lke
grandmothers and beautiful ones hke mothers There
are fames clad in rags and fairies clad in gold, just as
there are poor mothers and rich mothers with wonderful
evening dresses, and all spol their children The adult,
be he wretched or proud, is always a powerful bemg
to the child, and thus in real life the child begins that
attempt at exploitation that must end in conflict In
the beginning such confhict 1s sweet, for the adult allows

211
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

himself to be vanquished and gives way for the pleasure
of seemg hus child happy and contented Yes, the adult
who will prevent the child from washing his own hands
wul certainly try to satisfy his mama for possession
But the child, after a first victory, seeks a second, and
the more the grown-up gives in, the more the child
wants, till the dlusion that the grown-up was made
to see his child satisfied ends in bitter disappomtment
Since the material world has inexorable lumits, whereas
imagination may wander m infinity, the moment
comes when there 1s a real clash, a violent conflict.
The child’s wilfulness becomes the adult’s pumshment
Indeed, he at once recognises hus fault and says, “I
have spoilt my child ”

Even the submissive child can vanquish the adult,
by hus affectionate ways, his tears, his pleading, his
sad little face, his attractive graces To him, too, the
adult must give i, till he can give m no longer, and
then comes the unhappiness that no deviation from a
normal state can fail to brmg The adult reflects and
at last realises that he has treated the child in such a
way as to develop his vices, then he tries to turn back
and to correct him

But everyone knows that nothing will correct a
child’s wilfulness Neither exhortations nor punishments
will be any good, it 1s as if you were to preach a
jong sermon to a man dehrious with fever, telling him
that it would be much better for him to be well and
threatemmg to beat hum if he does not make his tem-
perature fall The fact is that the adult spoiled his

212
THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX

child not by giving way to him, but by preventing him
from really living, thus driving him into deviation

THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX

The adult then shows the child a contempt which
consciously he is far from feeling, for he believes his
child to be beautiful and perfect and projects into him
lus own pride and his own hope for the future But
there 1s a secret urge in him that is something more
than the conviction that the child 1s “empty” or
“naughty” and therefore to be filled and amended by
himself; it is something more than mere contempt for
the child For, the weak creature with which he 1s con-
fronted is his own child. Where that child is concerned’
the adult is all-powerful. He has even the right to show
feelings that he would be ashamed to show in the society
of other adults. Among his obscure tendencies are
avarice and a feeling of tyranny and absolutism And
thus in the home, camouflaged as paternal authority,
the slow, continuous demohtion of the child ego is
brought about. If, for example, a grown-up sees the
child moving a glass, he thinks and fears that the
glass will get broken At that moment avarice makes
him look upon the glass as a treasure and in order to
save it he will stop the child from moving. Perhaps
the adult nm question is a very mch man, who thinks
he will merease his wealth tenfold so that his son may
be even richer than he But at that moment he feels,
that the glass 1s immensely precious, to be saved at any
cost. On the other hand, he thinks: “Why should this
child put the glass im one way when I have put it in-

213
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

another? Am I not the authority who can dispose of
things as he hkes?” And yet this adult in hus heart
would be content to make any sacrifice for his child
He dreams of seemg him one day trumphant, he would
like him to become a famous, powerful man But
at that moment the tyrannical, authontarian tendency
surges up in him, frittering itself away in the mere
supervision of an object of no value In fact, if a
servant made the same movement, the father would
smile, and if a guest happened to break the glass he
would hasten to reassure him that it did not matter,
that the glass was of no value The child must thus
notice with despairmg constancy that he alone 1s
considered dangerous to things, and thus he alone 1s
thought incapable of touching them, he is an inferior
creature worth almost less than things

There 1s another complexus of ideas to be con-
sidered im relation to the mner building up of the child
He needs not only to touch things and to work with
them, but to follow a sequence of actions to its com-
pletion, and this 1s of the greatest importance im the
inward building-up of his personality The adult no
longer consciously notes the sequence of his daily
actions, for he possesses them as something that 1s part
of his very existence, as a mode of being When he gets
up in the morning, he knows that he must do this and
that, and he does them as the most natural things mn
the world Sequence of action has become almost
automatic, and he no longer notices it any more than
he notices his breathing or his heart-beats The child
on the contrary needs to lay this foundation But he

214
THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX

can never make a plan of action to be carried out con-
secutively If he 1s playing, a grown-up comes to say
it 1s time to go for a walk, and dresses him and takes
him away Or else, when he 1s performing some little
task, such as filing a bucket with stones, one of his
mother’s friends comes along, and lis mother calls hm
away from his work to show him to the new arnval
In the child’s life grown-ups are continually inter-
vemmng, powerful beings able to dispose of his life with-
out ever consultmg lim, without considermg him,
showing that his actions have no value, whereas in
hus presence, an adult will not turn to another, not even
to a servant, to mterrupt what he is domg without
saying, “Wall you be so kind,” or “If you can” The
child therefore feels that he is a creature different from
all others, with a special mfenority that sets him below
all others Now, as we have said, a sequence of actions
resulting from an inwardly predetermined plan is of
the very highest importance in the child’s development.
One day the adult will explain to him that he must
be responsible for his own actions, but the first foun-
dation of such responsibility hes in a complete pattern
of the connection between one action and another, and
in a judgment as to their significance But the child
feels only that all lus actions are insigmficant. The
adult, the father, who complams that he cannot arouse
that feelmg of responsibility and mastery over his own
actions in his son, himself step by step broke down
the child’s conception of the continuity of the successive
actions of life, and his feeling of his own dignity In
such cases, mstead of feeling a consciousness of his own

215
14
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

dignity, the child bears withm him an obscure con-
viction of inferiority and impotence To assume any
responsibility umples a conviction of bemg master of
one’s own actions and confidence in oneself There 1s
no discouragement hike that which springs from the
conviction, “I can’t” If a paralysed child were told to
race with a very active one, he would not wish to
run at all , 1f a skilful giant were set to box with a small,
mexpert man, the latter would not wish to fight The
possibility of effort 1s quenched before it has been tned,
leaving behind a feelmg of meapacity before the test
has been made Now the adult 1s continually quench-
ang the child’s sense of effort, when he humuhates the
child’s sense of his own strength and convinces him of
wecapacity For, in fact, the adult does not content
bumself with umpedmg the child m his actions, but
tells hum “You can't do that, it 1s no use trymg,” or
if it is someone of rougher manners, it will be, “You
silly, why d’you want to do that, don’t you see you
can’t?” And this militates not only against the child’s
work and his sequences of action, but against bis very
personality It implants in his soul the feeling not only
that his actions have no value, but that his personalty
utself 1s inept and incapable Then comes discourage-
ment, lack of self-confidence For if we find that it 1s.
someone stronger who prevents us from domg some-
thing we had mtended, we can say to ourselves that
lus place may by taken by someone weaker, and then
we can begin again. But if the adult convinces the
child that the incapacity les in himself, then a kind of
cloud covers his mind, bringing timidity, and a land

216
THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX

of apathy, and a fear, which become constitutional.
All these feelmgs together form the :nner obstacle that
psycho-analysis describes as an “inferiority complex ”
It 1s an obstacle that may remam permanently as a
humulbating sense of incapacity and inferiority to others,
and this prevents participation m the social tests that
arise at every step of life

This inferiority complex leads to timidity, hesitancy
in decision, sudden withdrawals before any difficulty or
criticism, with an outward expression of despair in the
ready tears that accompany such painful situations

Now the child’s normal nature reveals as one of
its most striking characteristics self-confidence and
surety of action While the little boy at San Lorenzo
showed the disappomted visitors that though it was a
holiday the children could open the classroom and
work even in the absence of their teacher, he showed
a perfect and balanced strength of character, which
was not a presuming on his own strength but a know-
ledge and control of it The child knows what he is
undertaking and dommmates the sequence of actions
necessary to its performance so that he 1s able to do it
with absolute simplicity without feeling he has done
anything out of the ordinary In the same way a child
who was putting words together out of a movable
alphabet, showed no perturbation when the Queen of
Italy stopped m front of him and told him to wnte
“Viva VItaha!” He at once began to put the letters
back in their order, as calmly as if he had been alone
In homage to the Queen, he suspended what he was
doing, in order to do what she had asked of hum

217
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

But there was a special detail not to be overlooked
he had to put all the letters back im thew order before
‘using them again for other words And, in fact, having
done so, he set to work to compose the words “Viva
VItaha’’ Here was someone able to dominate his
emotions and his actions, a httle man four years old,
who could onent himself with perfect surety to meet
the mcidents that might arise in his environment

FEAR

Another form of deviation is fear, which 1s con-
sidered a natural characteristic of childhood When
people speak of a fearful child they refer to a fear
resultmg from some deep-seated disturbance, almost
independently of the conditions of his environment, and
which, like shyness, 1s a part of his character There
are submissive children who, one might say, are en-
veloped as with an anguished aura of fear Others, on
the contrary, who are sturdy and active and courageous
um danger, may reveal mysterious and wlogical fears
that cannot be overcome These states of mind may
be interpreted as resultmg from strong mmpressions re~
cerved in the past, as, for instance, fear of crossing a
road, fear that there are cats under the bed, fear at the
sight of a hen, that 1s to say, states similar to the pho-
bias psychiatry has studied m the adult. All forms of
fear exist m an especial manner in the children who are
“dependent on the adult,” and the adult, m order to
obtain obedience, profits by the nebulous state of con-
sciousness of the child to impress upon it artificially
fear of vague bemgs who work in darkness Thus 1s one

218
FEAR

of the most pernicious forms of the adult's defence
agamst the child, it aggravates his natural fear of dark-
ness and peoples it with termfying images.

Everything that brings the child into contact with
reality and allows hum to gain experience of the things
of his environment, and hence an understanding of
such things, tends to liberate him from the disturbing
state of fear In our normalising schools the disap-
pearance of subconscious fears, or their failure to ap-
pear, 1s one of the clearest results An important
Spanish wnter wished to write of this phenomenon
which struck him as a fact worthy to be known by the
public. He had three daughters who were already
big gitls, and a fourth little girl who attended one of
our schools If there was a thunderstorm dunng the
night the youngest was the only one of the four who
was not afraid, and she would lead her elder sisters
through the house to their parents’ room, where they
used to take refuge on such occasions Her presence,
through her freedom from mysterious fears, was a real
comfort to the others And thus if, as sometimes
happened, the bigger girls were afraid at night, they
used to go to their little sister i order to throw off
the umpression

A “state of fear” is different from fear arising from
a normal instinct of self-preservation in the presence
of danger Now this kind of normal fear 1s less fre-
quent among children than among grown-ups This
is not only because children have had less experience
than adults of outward dangers One might even say
that it 1s a prevailing charactenstic of childhood to face

219
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

danger, and that this 1s proportionately far more deve-
Joped than in adults In fact, children repeatedly expose
themselves to danger, like the children in the streets
who hang on to moving traffic or m the country chmb
the highest trees or crawl down precipices They will
fing themselves to the sea or into rivers, and often
learn to swim at thew own risk. There 1s no counting
the number of cases of child heroism when children
have saved or tried to save the Jives of their playfellows
I wall quote only the case of a fire in an mstitution
mm. Cahfornia, m which one wing was reserved for
blind children The bodies of normal children were
found, who, though hving m another part of the
building, had run to lead the blind ones to safety In
child organisations like the Boy Scouts, or m bodies
of mobihsed childhood like the Balilla, every day brings
some example of heroism

It may be asked whether normalisation develops
this heroic tendency to be found so frequently among
children In our experience of normalisation we have
had no heroic episodes, unless we accept the expres-
sion of some noble desire, which 1s, however, a very
different thing from a real heroic action (There was
the child of five who on heanng of the Messina earth-
quake wrote a sentence for the first tume, “If I was big
T would go and help”) But the real and ordinary
incidents in the lives of our children are to be referred
to a “prudence” that allowed them to avoid dangers
and hence to take a middle course This has led to a
precocious form of hfe , for example, they are early
able to handle knives at table or even im the kitchen ,

220
REPERCUSSIONS ON PHYSICAL LIFE

to handle matches and to light the fire or even fire-
works They can be left free near ponds or cisterns,
and can cross the road im town In short, they are able
to control their actions and at the same time control
their rasher impulses, thus attammg a serene and loftier
form of life. Normahsation therefore does not make
them run into danger but develops a prudence that
allows them to go about m the midst of dangers,
knowing thenr and mastering them

REPERCUSSIONS ON PHYSICAL LIFE

There are a large number of characteristics which
psychic deviations bring in their tram, some of which
appear of a wholly different order, for they affect the
functionmg of the body To-day, thanks to psycho-
analysis, the psychological causes of many physical
disturbances form a chapter of medicine that has
received considerable study There are also defects
that seem essentially bodily of which the remote ongms
he in the domain of the mind Some of these, such as
digestive disturbances, affect children especially
Sturdy, active children show tendencies to a kind of
voracious hunger which it is hard to check by traming
or diet Such children eat more than is necessary
through an irresistible urge that 1s often complacently
considered as a “good appetite,” though it leads to
digestive disturbances and toxic conditions which bring
them continually into the doctor’s hands.

Antiquity saw a vice of a moral order in the wild
tendency of the body to absorb more food than it
needed, doing itself no good, or rather domg itself

221
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

harm Such a tendency seems to reveal a suspension
of the normal sensibility towards food, which should
not only urge to the quest of food, but also lumut its
consumption to what 1s necessary This 1s what we
find in the ammals, the health of which is entrusted
to a guiding mstmect of preservation This imstinct
of preservation has two aspects, the one related to
the environment, the avoidance of dangers, the other
to the mdividual itself, and governmg its consump-
tion of food In animals the prevailng mstmct not
only leads them to proper food but determines sts
quantity It is mdeed one of the most distinctive
charactenstics of all ammal species Whether they
eat much or hittle, each species m a natural state
observes the measure nature has implanted im it in
the form of instinct.

Man, on the other hand, shows a gluttony which
not only leads him to a senseless accumulation of
excessive quantities of food but brings a tendency
to consume substances that are actually poisonous
‘We may say then that the appearance of psychic
deviation brings with it the loss of the protective
sensibiktes that would guide man towards health
Of this we find clear proof in the “deviated” child,
who at once shows a lack of balance m his feeding
Food allures him from without by its appearance, it 1s
greeted only by the external sense of taste, but the
inner vital factor, the preserving sensibility, 1s enfeebled
or lost. One of the most startlng demonstrations
im our normalising schools was the fact that the
children, as they recovered from psychic deviation and

222
REPERCUSSIONS ON PHYSICAL LIFE

were restored to a normal state, lost all signs of greedi-
ness and ceased to show their former voracious hunger
What interested them was the precise performance of
each action, so that they might eat with correct ges-
tures This restoration of vital sensibility aroused an
almost incredulous wonder in the early days when
people spoke of child conversions Certain scenes of
child life formed the subject of mmute description,
im order to convince people that this phenomenon was
a real fact. Tiny children, when the hour came for
a well-deserved meal and they were faced by an ap-
petismg dish, spent their tume adjusting ther napkins,
looking at the covers so as to remember the exact way
of holding and using each umplement, or of helpmg
a smaller comrade, and sometimes they were so mett-
culous that the dish got cold before they ate it Other
children were sad because they had hoped to be chosen
to wait at table, and mstead there they were con-
demned to the easiest task of all, that of eating

A counter-proof of the correspondence between
psychological factors and food 1s to be found m an
Opposite fact Submissive children have a strange and
often mvincible reluctance to eat at all Many people
have expemenced this difficulty m feeding certam
children These refuse to eat, to such an extent as to
create real difficulties n the family or in educational
institutions Such a phenomenon 1s the more stnking
when it occurs in stitutions for poor, weak children,
whom one would expect to seize any favourable occa-
sion for eating their fill It may become so serious as
to produce a physical dechne impervious to all attempts

223
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

at cure This refusal of food must not be confused
with dyspepsia, when the digestive organs are ima
genuinely abnormal state, producing lack of appetite
Here the child 1s prevented from eatmg by some
psychological cause In some cases it springs from a
defensive impulse against attempts to feed him, or
when the child 1s forced to eat quickly, that 1s, with the
thythm of the adult The child has a rhythm of his
own, and this has now been recognised by chud speci-
alists, who note that children do not eat all the food
they need at one go, but interpose long pauses m their
slow eating This we find in babies before they are
weaned, which stop sucking not because they have had
enough, but im order to rest, for their rhythm 1s not
only slow but intermittent. We can therefore recognise
a possible defensive impulse, like a barrier, agamst the
violence by which the baby was forced to feed inde-
pendently of the laws of its nature There are however
cases in which there can be no question of such defence
A child may seem almost constitutionally lacking 0
appetite He 1s incurably pale, and no treatment, not
even open-air hfe, sunlight, or sea air can mend hum
But in such cases we find that he is overshadowed by
some adult to whom he 1s extremely attached, and who
exercises a repressive influence Then only one thing
can cure him—to send him away from such influence
to an environment where he will be psychologically free
and active, so that he will lose an attachment that 1s
deforming his spint

In support of our thesis we may note that there
has always been a recognition of the relationslup

224
REPERCUSSIONS ON PHYSICAL LIFE

between psychological life and those physical pheno-
mena that are considered as most remote from mind,
such as eatmg In Buble history, we find the case of
Esau, who through an impulse of greed, surrendered
hus rights as first-born, thus actmg against his own
interest, without mtelligence. Gluttony indeed 1s classed
among the vices that “darken the mud” It 1s nterest~
ing to see the precision with which St. Thomas Aquinas
underlines the connection between gluttony and itel-
lectual conditions He mamtains that gluttony blunts
judgment and as a result weakens man’s cognition of
intelligible realities In the child, however, we find
the reverse process at work psychological disturbance
givmg rise to gluttony The Chnstian religion so
relates this vice to disturbances of a spiritual order that
it puts it among the seven deadly sins, that is among
those that lead to the death of the soul, to a way that
1s barred through a disturbance in some of the
mysterious laws that govern the universe At the same
tume, from another, wholly moder and scientific stand-
pont, psycho-analysis indirectly supports our theory of
a loss of the guiding instinct or preserving sensibility
To this, however, psycho-analysis gives a different in-
terpretation, and speaks of the “death-instinct.” That
1s to say, it recognises in man a natural tendency to
assist the inevitable advent of death, facilitating it and
hastening it, and even running to meet it by suicide
Man becomes attached to poisons lke alcohol, opium,
cocame, by an wresistible urge, that is, he attaches
bumself to death and summons it, stead of attaching
himself to life and salvation But does not all this

225
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

indicate precisely the loss of a vital mner sensibihty,
which should work for the preservation of the indivi-
dual? If such a tendency were due to the inevitability
of death, it should exist m all creatures We should
rather say that all psychic deviation sets man on the
road to death and makes him active mn destroymg his
own life, and that this terrible tendency shows itself
in a fait and almost imperceptible form im earlest
infancy

All ilinesses may have a psychological co-efficient,
for psychological life and physical life are closely con-
nected, but abnormality in feeding opens the door to
all and summons all Sometimes, however, the illness
1s merely a semblance, with purely psychological causes,
as though it were an image and not a reality §Psycho-
analysis has thrown much light on such cases in deal-
ing with orgamic neurosis Organic neuroses are not
simulated illnesses, but present genume symptoms,
feverish temperatures, and functional disturbances that
sometimes appear serious And yet such illnesses are
not physical, for they are generated in the unconscious
by psychological factors able to dommate physiological
laws By ulness the ego 1s able to escape from un-
pleasant situations and obligations The ilness resists
all treatment, and disappears only when the ego 1s freed
from the conditions it sought to escape I witnessed
cases of this kind in a religious educational institution
for little girls, which from the point of view of hygiene
left nothing to be deswed And yet there were sick
children im the infirmary, some of them with persistent
temperatures that it was not easy to cure These ul-

226
REPERCUSSIONS ON PHYSICAL LIFE

nesses disappeared with the abolition of the obliga-
tion of attendance at the first early morning Mass

Many illnesses and morbid states, hke many moral
defects, may disappear when children are placed m
a free environment and allowed to engage m norma-
lising activities. To-day, many child-specialists recog-
mise our schools as houses of health where they may
send children with functional diseases which have resist-
ed all ordinary attempts at cure Surprising cures have
been thus obtained

LYING

Psychic deviation, though it may show an infinity
of particular characteristics, like the buds and branches
of a flounshing tree, springs always from the same
deep roots, and it 1s mn dealing with these that the
single secret of normalisation hes Whereas in ordinary
psychology and m current methods of education such
particular consequences are considered as separate
defects, to be studied and dealt with separately as
though they were actually independent of each other.

One of the chief of such particular consequences
is lyng Lies are like clothing that hides the soul—a
whole trousseau of many different garments, for there
are so many and such different kinds of les, each with a
different significance There are normal lies and patho-
logical hes The old psychiatry dealt fully with the
irrepressible lying associated with hystena, when the
he covers the whole soul and language becomes a
fabric of hes It was also psychiatry that drew atten-
tion to the les told by children in children’s courts, and

227
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

am general to the possible unconscious lying of children
called as witnesses It was startling to realise or dis-
cover that the child whose “innocent soul” was almost
a synonym of truth (truth speaking through the mouth
of mnocence), might bear false witness im all sincerity
The attention of criminological psychologists was drawn
to these amazing facts, and it was recognised that such
children were truly sincere, and that their hes were due
to a form of mental confusion, aggravated by the emo-
tion of the moment.

This substitution of falsehood for truth, whether
as a permanent state or as an episodic event, 1s certamly
something far removed from the normal fibs of a child
seeking to hide himself by conscious self-defence But
ain normal children and im ordmary daily hfe we also
find hes that have nothing to do with defence The
lie may be a real mvention, born of a need to recount
something fantastic, with the added piquant pleasure
of having it believed as true by others, yet it 1s not told
aa order to deceive or with any am of personal
advantage It 1s then a genume form of art, like that
of an actor who identifies himself with the character
he plays I will give an example One day some
children told me that ther mother, when someone
important was coming to dinner, prepared some vege-
table juices full of vitamins with her own hands, as an
advertisement for eating things raw She succeeded,
they said, im making such a delicious natural liqueur
that her guest said he would use it and tell others of
it The story was so detailed and so interesting that I
asked their mother to tell me how she prepared her

228
LYING

vitamin juices She replied that she had never even
thought of making anything of the kind Here is an
example of something wholly created by a child’s
umagination, translated mto a full-fledged he and pro-
duced mm society, with no other aim than the pure
pleasure of romancing.

Lies of this kind are almost the opposite of others
which are told from laziness, when the child will not
bother to think what was the truth Sometimes
however, a le may be the result of astute reasoning I
once knew a httle boy of six who had been temporarily
sent to boarding-school The teacher in charge of the
group of children in which he found humself was
particularly suited to her office and had a great adm-
ration for this particular child After a time the little
boy complamed to his mother of this teacher, giving
a quantity of details against her He described her as
altogether too severe His mother went to the head-
mustress to make enquiries, and received full proof that
the teacher in question had a real weakness for her son
and had always surrounded him with affectionate care
The mother then confronted him and asked him why
he had told such hes “They weren’t hes,” he said, “but
I couldn’t say 1t was the headmistress who was nasty ”
It did not seem as if he lacked the courage to accuse
the headmustress, but rather as if he felt the force of
convention Much could be said of the cunning of
which children are capable in adapting themselves to
their environment

Weak charactered, submissive children, on the
contrary, tell hes that are made up on the spur of the

229

moment, as by a defensive reflex, without a mentally
elaborated content, and without the coloured clouds
of imaginative castles These are the naive, unorga-
mised, improvised and therefore easily recognisable lies
against which parents and teachers wage war, forgettmg
that their sigmficance 1s clearly and genumely a
defence agaist the attacks of the adult. The charges
which the adult in such cases makes against the child
accusing him of weakness and shameful mferiority and
denouncing the unworthmess of such les, are a simple
recognition that such hes reveal an inferior beg

Fibbmg is one of the psychological phenomena
which m infancy are still im process of formation but
which orgamse themselves with time and come to form
so important a part of human social life as to be m-
dispensable, decent and even aesthetic, lke clothes for
the body

In our normalising schools the child’s soul sheds
its camouflage and reveals its natural sincerity None
the less, fibbing 1s not one of the deviations that vamsh
as if by a miracle It requires a reconstruction rather
than a conversion Clarity of ideas, union with reality,
freedom of spint and an active interest in lofty objects,
form an environment propitious to the reconstruction
of a sincere soul

But if we analyse social hfe, we find that it is per-
meated by lying as by an atmosphere that could not
be dissipated without convulsing society In fact, many
of our children who went on to ordinary secondary
schools were judged impertinent or insubordinate simply
because they were much more sincere than others, and

had not developed certain necessary forms of adapta-
tion This their teachers did not recogmse Discipline
and social relations were indeed organised on lies, and
an unfamiliar smcerity seemed to upset the moral con-
struction established as the basis of education

One of the most brillant contributions of psycho-
analysis to the story of the human soul is its inter-
pretation of camouflage as unconscious adaptation
itis the adult’s forms of camouflage and not the child’s
fibs that represent the terrible garment that comes to
form part of life, to be compared to the pelt or plumage
of the animal kingdom, that is, to a protective clothing
that covers, embellishes and defends the vital machinery
at work beneath 1t Camouflage is the lie of feeling,
a le that man builds in humself m order to live, or
better, in order to survive, m a world with which lis
pure and natural feelings would be in conflict. And
since it 1s not possible to live in a state of perpetual
conflict, the soul must adapt itself One of the most
singular of such forms of camouflage is the attitude
of the adult to the child The adult sacrifices the child’s
needs to his own, but he does not live m a state—which
would be intolerable—of recognising that he does so
So he persuades himself that he is exercising a natural
night and is acting for the child’s future good When
the little one defends itself, the soul of the adult 1s not
awakened to the true state of things, but all that the
child does in defence of his life 1s called disobedience,
or bad tendencies. Little by little the voice of truth and
justice, faint as it was, disappears, and its place 1s
taken by bniliant, sohd, permanent forms of camou-

flage which appear as duty, right, authority, prudence,
etc “The heart hardens, it turns to ice and shines
hike something transparent All that falls agamst it 1s
broken. My heart has become a stone, I stnke it
and it 1s my hand that is wounded.”? It 1s by a beauti-
ful metaphor that im the depths of Dante’s Inferno,
where, all love 1s extinguished, and only hatred remains,
there 1s ice Love and hate are two differmg states of
the soul, lke the liquid and sohd states of water Yes,
such camouflage 1s the he of the spit, which helps
man to adapt himself to the organised deviations of
society, and which hittle by little hardens what was once
love into forms of hate

This is the fearful le that hides m the secret

Tue Instinct To Work

Berore these revelations of true child nature, the
Jaws governing the building up of psychological hfe
had remained absolutely unknown The study of the
sensitive periods as directing the formation of man may
become one of the sciences of the greatest practical use
to mankind.

The foundation of development and growth hes
im progressive and ever more mtimate relations between
the individual and his environment, for the develop-
ment of individuality, and of what 1s called the free-
dom of the child, can be nothmg else than his pro-
gressive independence of the adult, realised by means
of a suitable environment im which he can find the
necessary means of evolving his functions This 1s as
clear and sumple as the fact that in weaning a baby we
prepare baby food from cereals, fruit juices and vegeta-
bles, that is to say, by usmg the products of the outer
world in place of the mother’s milk

The absurd mistake m envisaging the freedom of
the child in education has Jam in imaging his hypo-
thetical independence of the adult without correspond-
img preparation of the environment. This preparation
of the environment is part of the science of education,
just as the preparation of baby food 1s part of the
science of health Now the preparation of the psychic

234
LHE INDLINGL 10 WUKK

environment, in its essential principles, as a basis of a
new education, has been outlined by the child himself
clearly enough for it to become a practical reality

Among the revelations the child has brought us
there is one of fundamental importance, the pheno-
menon of normalisation through work Thousands
and thousands of experments among children of every
race enable us to state that this phenomenon 1s the
most certain datum verified in psychology or education
It is certain that the child’s aptitude for work repre-
sents a vital mstinct, for without work his personality
cannot organise itself, and deviates from the normal
les of its construction Man builds bumself through
working Nothing can take the place of work, nerther
physical well-bemg nor affection, and, on the other
hand, deviations cannot be corrected by either punish-
ment or example Man builds himself through working,
working with his hands, but using his hands as the
instruments of his ego, the organ of his individual
mind and will, which makes its own experuments face
to face with its environment The child’s instinct
confirms the act that work 1s an mbherent tendency in
human nature, it 1s the characteristic instinct of the
human race

How then could it ever have come to pass that
work, which should represent the supreme satisfac-
tion, the centre of health and regeneration, as it does
for the child, should be rejected by the adult man?
However could it have been thought that work was
a product of harsh necessities created by his environ-
ment? Perhaps because work in human society rests

235
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

on mistaken foundations It develops from deviated
man, deviated through possession, power, apathy,
attachment, so that the deep-seated instinct remams
budden as a suppressed characteristic Then work
depends only on external circumstances, or on struggles
between deviated men. It becomes forced labour,
giving rise to potent psychic barriers, and thus becomes
hard and repellent.

But when through exceptional circumstances work
1s the result of an inner, instinctive impulse, then even
in the adult 1t assumes a wholly different character
Such work 1s fascinating, wresistible, and it raises man
above deviations and attachments Such is the work
of the mventor or discoverer, the heroic efforts of the
explorer, or the compositions of the artist, that 1s to say,
the work of men gifted with such an extraordinary
power as to enable them to rediscover the instinct of
their species in the patterns of their own individuality
This instinct is then a fountain that bursts through the
hard outer crust and mses, through a profound urge,
to fall, as refreshing ram, on arid humanity It 18
through this urge that the true progress of civilisation
takes place

THE CONFLICT BETWEEN CHILD AND ADULT
The conflict between adult and child 1s the starting
point for consequences that will widen and widen
almost to infinity im the life of man, hike the mpples
that spread out further and further if you drop a stone
on the clear surface of quiet waters Such consequences
are vibrations that spread out in a circle on every side

236
CONFLICT BETWEEN CHILD AND ADULT

This 1s precisely what medicine and psycho-analy-
sis have discovered in going back to the original causes
ofphysical and mental diseases Psycho-analysts must
travel a long road im thew search for the pmmary
ongms of mental diseases, ke the explorers, who,
seeking the sources of the Nile, had far to go, meeting
terrifymng cataracts on thew journey, till they reached
the calm waters of the great lakes Those sciences that
have sought to sound the ongins of weakness, incapa-
city, resistance and distortion mm the human soul, have
had to go far beyond immediate causes; far deeper than
conscious and comprehensible causes, till they reached
the quiet waters, the body and soul of the infant child.

But if we want to take the contrary path and are
interested in the new history of humanity as it is written
in the secrecy of the formation of its elements, then we
can start from the calm lakes of first infancy, and follow
the tumultuous river of life as 1t springs forth and flows
down from the mountains, in and out of obstacles,
deviating and twisting im its difficult journey, leaping
down abysses, able to do anythmg but remain still,
anything but cease to augment the turbulent mass of
its waters

If the most visible ills afflicting adult man, physical
disease and nervous and mental disease, can really be
traced to childhood, it 1s the hfe of the child that can
show us the details, the first signs and causes that will
accompany such evils step by step

There is, however, another act to be considered,
and that 1s that every great and visible evil is surround-
ed by an infimty of lesser evils The cases of death

237
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

through disease are few compared to the cases in
which the same disease 1s cured And if illness 1s the
sign of a weakness that has not been able to resist ats
assault, there must be many who are weak even if they
have not remained a prey to disease Abnormal condi-
tions predisposing to disease are also to be compared
to the waves that transmit the vibrations of the ether
to infinity That ts why anyone examming water to
know if it 1s pure and fit for drinking does not take it
all but exammes a small quantity of it only If that
portion 1s mfected, he concludes that all the water
1s infected Thus if there are deaths from disease or
men lost in madness, we must say that there 1s error in
the whole of mankind

This is no new idea In the days of Moses it was
recognised that there was an error at the very origins
of mankind, an ongimal sm indicating that all mankind
was infected and lost Onginal sin seems an illogical
and unjust conception because it envisages the possible
condemnation of the mnumerable innocents destined
to make up humanity, but we may observe a parallel
fact, for we find mnocent children condemned to bear
the fatal consequences of a mustaken development.
The causes of which we treat he m the conflict that
exists at the base of human hfe, a conflict big with
consequences and which has never been explored The
adult and the child, made to love one another and to
live together, find themselves mm conflict through an
incomprehension that corrodes the roots of life, and
which takes place in impenetrable secrecy

The questions bearing on this conflict are manifold

238
CONFLICT BETWEEN CHILD AND ADULT

and some, which are clear and tangible, affect out-
ward social relations The adylt has a mission to ful-
fil which has been so complicated and imtensified that
he finds it ever harder to suspend it as he must do if
he 1s to follow the child, adaptmg himself to the
child’s rhythm and the psychological needs of his
growth But on the other hand, the mcreasmg com-
plexity and speed of the adult’s environment becomes
more and more unsuited to the child We can ima-
gine a simple and peaceful state of prmutive hfe m
which the little child finds a natural refuge He sees
the adult domg simple work in slow rhythm, he 1s
surrounded by domestic anunals and sees them hving

out arousing any protest. He sleeps when he is sleepy,
throwing himself down in the shade of a tree But
little by little civilisation closes the social world to the
child Everything 1s over-regulated, too narrow, too
encumbered, too fast’. Not only 1s the quick rhy-
thm of the busy adult an obstacle to hum, but the
machine comes along, carrying away like an ampe-
tuous wind every little vestige of the world m which
the child could take refuge. Then he cannot hve

world Thus he becomes a refugee, a helpless crea-
ture, a slave No one thinks of the need of creating
a special environment for his hfe, no one thinks that
he too needs to be active and to work It 1s neces-
sary to realise that there are two social questions be-
cause there are two forms of life, and hence two needs
to consider—the social question of the adult and the
social question of the child In each sphere there 1s
essential work to be done, the work of the adult and
the work of the child are both essential for the hfe of
humanity

THE ADULT'S TASK

It 1s the adult’s task to build an environment
super-imposed on nature, a outward work callmg
for activity and intelligent effort, 1t 1s what we call
productive work, and 1s by its nature social, collective
and organised To attain the end of his work in society,
man must necessarily order it, regulate it by norms that
are the laws of society They umpose a collective dis-
ciphne to which men voluntarily submit, for they
themselves have recognised such laws as essential if
social life is to be orderly and fruitful But besides the
laws which, representing local and temporal necessities,
differ from one human group to another and from age
to age, there are other basic Jaws of which the roots he
in human nature itself, and which concern work in
itself , such laws are common to all men and all ages
One of these, the law of division of labour, universal
im application among all living creatures, 1s necessary
1n order that men’s production should be differentiated

240
THE ADULT’S TASK

Another natural law concerns instead the individual
worker, and is the law of least effort by which man
seeks to produce the most he can, working as little as
he can This law is of very great importance not
because of the existence of the wish to work as httle
as possible but because, by following it, production 1s
mereased with less expenditure of energy This is a
principle of such practical utility that it apples also
to the machine taking the place of human labour or
completing it

These are the social and natural “good laws” of
adaptation m work.

But not everything proceeds i accordance with
these “good laws,” for the matenal with which man
works and produces wealth 1s limited, and m the com-
petitive struggle that ensues the application of such laws
degenerates

Then evil human habits come to the fore, and
seizure of others’ labours takes the place of division
of labour In place of the law of least effort the prin-
ciple of making others work creeps in. “Let them
work so that I may profit by their labour while I rest.”
Such degenerations combine with the “good laws” and
establish the social form of adult labour, under a
camouflage of the nght of property

The child who 1s essentially a natural being lives
with the adult as far as his material existence 1s con-
cerned. But he remains permanently alien to the social
labour of the adult; his activity cannot be used in
social production We must indeed hold this principle
present to our consciousness that the child has no possi-

241
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

bility of sharing 1n the social labour of the adult. If
we take as symbol of manual work that of the smith
striking with the sledge on the anvil, the child cannot
make such an effort. If we take as symbol of intellec-
tual work that of the scientist as he handles his instru-
ments in some difficult piece of research, the child can-
not make the smallest contmbution m this field Or
if we think of a legislator meditating on the best laws,
his place can never be taken by the child

The child ts thus essentially alien to this society
of men and might express his position in the words
of the Gospel, “My Kmgdom 1s not of this world”
He 1s a bemg outside the organisation created by men,
outside the artificial world the adult has superposed
on nature In the world ito which he 1s born the child
4s an extra-social bemg par excellence We call a man
extra-social who cannot adapt himself to society, who
cannot take an active part in its productive labours
nor in the rules of its orgamsation, and who 1s thus a
disturber of the established order The fact 1s that the
child 1s an extra-social bemg who 1s perpetually dis-
turbing the adult, even in the house of his parents His
capacity for adaptation 1s aggravated by the fact
that he is actve and cannot renounce his actiwity
Hence a need to make war on hum, he must be taught
not to interfere, not to disturb, till he 1s reduced to
passivity Or else he must be relegated to ving na
place apart, which, if it 1s not the prison assigned to
extra-social adults, 1s something corresponding, be its
name nursery or school Here are places to which the
child 1s relegated till he can live im the adult world

242
THE CHILD'S TASK

without disturbing 1t Then he may be admitted to
society But at first he 1s subject to the adult lke a
person with no civil nghts, or indeed without even civil
existence, a thing of naught The adult is his master ,
the child must remain at his orders, from which there
1s no appeal, and which are therefore considered as
@ prior: yust The little child comes into the family
out of nothmgness, and the grown-up to him 1s big
and powerful as a god, who alone can give him what
is necessary for his life The adult 1s his creator, his
providence, his master, the dispenser of punishments ,
no one can be so utterly and wholly dependent on
another as the child 1s on the adult.

THE CHILD’S TASK

But the child too 1s a worker anda producer If
he cannot take part in the adult’s work, he has his
own, a great, important, difficult work mdeed—the
work of producing man If from the new-born baby,
helpless, unconscious, dumb, unable to raise itself,
comes forth the individual adult with perfected form,
with a mind enriched with all the acquisitions of his
psychic life, radiant with the light of the spirit, this 1s
the child’s dong _It 1s the child who builds up the man,
the child alone The adult cannot take his place im this
work , the exclusion of the adult from the child’s
“world” and “work” is still more evident and more
absolute than the exclusion of the child from the work
producing the social order superimposed on nature in
which the adult reigns, The child’s work belongs to
another order and has a wholly different force from

243
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the work of the adult, Indeed one might say that the
one 1s opposed to the other The child’s work 1s done
unconsciously, in abandonment to a mysterious spiritual
energy, actively engaged im creation. It 1s mdeed a
creative work, it 1s perhaps the very spectacle of the
creation of man, as symbolically outlined in the Bible
A divine spit breathed mto man, of whom the
Scnptures say only that he was “‘created” But as to
how he was created, how that living creature received
the attributes of intelligence and power over all created
things, though he himself had come from nothing,
we may see and admure in all its details im the child,
m every child This wonderful spectacle is under
our eyes every day What was done was done so
that it should reproduce itself in every human creature
as in every living bemg There we find the hving
source of ummortality, in which nothing perishes and
everything is renewed We may repeat at every mo-
ment before the clear evidence of reality that the child
1s father to the man All the powers of the adult come
from the possibilty possessed by his “child-father”
to attain the full realisation of the secret pattern that
was his What, however, puts the child in the position
of a real worker 1s that he does not fulfil the pattern
of the man-to-be-made only through meditation and
rest No, his work 1s made up of activity, he creates by
continual exercise And we must clearly understand
that he too uses hus outer environment for his work,
the same environment that the adult uses and
transforms It 1s through exercise that the child
grows, his constructive activity 1s a real work

244
THE CHILD’S TASK

which overflows materially into his outer environment
The child in bis expermments exercises bumself and
moves , he thus learns to co-ordinate his movements
and absorbs from the outer world the emotions that
give concreteness to his intelligence He 1s laboriously
acquiring a language, through miraculous acts of atten-
uon and through umtial efforts possible to bum alone
He strives irrepressibly to stand on his feet. He runs,
he seeks And in so doing he 1s followmg a programme
and a tume-table like the most diligent scholar m the
world, with the unshakable constancy of the stars
in their mvisible courses Every year it will be possible
to measure his stature and he will have reached the
limit assigned to him We know that the child of
five will have reached a certam level of intelligence
and the child of eight another Seemg lum when
he 1s ten, we can say how tall he 1s and what he can
do, for the child will not disobey the programme
drawn up for him by nature Thus, through ide-
fatigable activity, made up of efforts, experiments, con-
quests and griefs, through harsh tnals and wearisome
struggles, he, step by step, fulfils his difficult and
glorious task, adding always a new form of perfection
The adult indeed perfects the environment, but the
child perfects being itself His efforts are like those
of a man walking without rest till he has reached
his goal Thus the perfection of the adult man depends
on the child

We, as adults, are dependent on him We are the
sons and dependents of the child in the sphere of
hus work, as he 1s our son and dependent in the

245
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

sphere of our work One 1s dependent in one sphere,
the other m another The adult 1s master im one
sphere, but the child is master m his own sphere
And thus the one depends on the other , they are both
kungs, but each with his own kingdom

This is the fundamental framework for harmony
among mankind

THE TWO TASKS COMPARED

Since the child’s work 1s made up of actions per-
formed on real objects m the outer world, it may
become the subject of positive study m order to
ascertam its laws and the ways in which it proceeds,
and to compare it with the adult’s work. Both adult
and child exercise an immediate action on their en-
vironments, an action that is conscious and willed, and
it 1s when it 1s willed that 1t may properly be considered
as work But besides this they each have an end to be
achieved, which is not directly known and willed
There 1s no vital existence, not even among the plants,
that does not imply hfe at the expense of environment
Or rather, life is an energy of the outer world, contmu-
ally recomposing an environment that would otherwise
disintegrate and thus constantly renewing it, holding
creation in beg For example, the immediate work
of the coral msects 1s to absorb carbonate of chalk from
the sea water and to make of it a protective covering,
whereas their end in respect of ther environment 1s
to create new contents And since this end is remote
from their immediate work, we may explore all there
as to explore m the coral reef by scientific research,

246
THE TWO TASKS COMPARED

but we shall not find a new continent. The same more
or less holds good for all living beings and especially
for man

But every infant bemg that 1s engaged in creating
an adult being has a non-proximate end that is none
the less visible and certam Studymg the child, or
infant fe im general, from every side, we may come
to know and discover everythmg about it, from the
atoms of its material existence to the smallest details
of all its functions, but one thing we shall not find—
the adult-to-be

Now the two ends remote from immediate action
both imply work that utilises the environment.

Sometmes nature m her more simple creatures
Presents examples that give glimpses into some of her
secrets Among insects, for instance, we may quote
two forms of genuine productive work The one is
suk, the shming thread of which men spin their most
precious stuffs, the other is the spider’s web, the frail,
dirty thread men hasten to destroy Now silk is the
work of an infant creature, the spider’s web that of an
adult, Indubitably we have to do with two different
workers When therefore we speak of the child’s work
and compare it with that of the adult, we speak of two
different kinds of activity with different ends, but both
equally real

Now what we need to know is the character of the
chuld’s work. When a little child works he does not
do so to attain an outward end The aim of his work
is the working, and when in his repetition of an ex-
ereise he brings it to an end, this end is independent

247

te
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

of external factors In respect of individual character-
istics, the end of the work 1s not even an effect of weari-
ness, for it 1s characteristic of the child to come forth
from his Jabour with new vigour and full of energy
Let us say, then, that his work 1s the satisfaction of an
inner need, a phenomenon of psychic maturation The
outer aim considered as a whole—that 1s, the object
on which he exercises his activity, the use of that object
and the end he has m view—reduces itself to a single
means of mner activity This activity 1s not bound up
with the object as though this were a mechanical
reagent determmmg a mechamical activity, but the
mind must play its parts The repetition of the act
spmngs from a knowledge accurately acquired both
through execution and through the aims to be achieved
And all this constitutes the necessary complex motive
for a formative exercise The child feels the need to
repeat this exercise not m order to perfect his perfor-
mance but m order to build up his own mner bemg,
and the time taken, the number of repetitions required,
the occult law inherent in the spiritual embryo is one
of the child’s secrets

This shows one of the differences between the
natural laws of adult work and those of the child’s
work. The child does not follow the law of the least
effort, but a law directly contrary He wastes an um-
mense amount of energy over an insubstantial end, and
he wastes not only driving energy but mtensive energy
m the exact execution of every detail The outward
action and the object are therefore a means of ever
transitory importance Such a relationship between the

248
THE TWO TASKS COMPARED

resources of the environment and the perfecting of
ner hfe is particularly striking, since for the adult
this very idea must inform his spitual hfe The man
who finds himself on a sublimated plane 1s not attached
to outward things, but merely uses them for the mo-
ment in a perfect manner such as suffices for his ner
perfecting Whereas the man on an ordinary plane,
that 1s, on his own plane, 1s so attached to things, to
outward ends, that he 1s ready to sacrifice himself to
them and to lose his soul and his health for thew sake.

Another differential feature, clear and indisputable,
between the adult’s work and the child’s work is
that the child’s work permits of no exploitation of
others, and no abbreviation. He must carry out the
work for his development alone and he must carry it
out in its entirety No one can take over his task and
grow for him To become a man of twenty he must
take twenty years. It is mdeed precisely the charac—
teristc of growing cluldhood to follow just a pro-
gramme and time-table unerringly, and unsparingly.
Nature is a severe task-mistress who pumshes the-
smallest disobedience by what we call arrested develop-
ment, or functional deviation ; m short, by wlness or
abnormality It is interesting for us to pause a moment
to consider the child as nature’s scholar, obeying per-
fectly a natural energy which guides him and sets him
a task which he will carry out with even more loyalty
than that demanded of kmghts of the Middle Ages by
their knightly honour. The child will grow im stature
and psychological capacity, as the programme Jaid
down by nature has ordained. As to how he does S80,,

249
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

how he sets about his mner building, that 1s a secret
he will not reveal—hike the diligent scholar who keeps
silence on what he does Only im special circumstances
wil revelations be made, we might say that the child
as nature’s scholar must from time to tume pass exami-
nations, thats, make exceptional efforts which will lead
him to achieve the various stages of his progress Such
are the sensitive periods through which all infant crea-
tures pass, from the msect to man

During these periods there are sensibilities charac-
teristic of the particular stage of growth and which
later disappear, and by this word sensibility we imply
also a special active capacity—a power of acting which
1s likewise transient and characteristic of a particular
stage, and which therefore must seem muraculous to
those who no longer possess it. Indeed we may say
that every acquisition made by a bemg mm evolution 1s
rendered possible by a sensitye period, just as the
scholar passes examinations not only m every subject
but im order to go from one grade to another in the
same subject.

GROWTH THROUGH ACTIVITY

The sensitive periods of creatures 2 process of
evolution are one of the greatest wonders of nature
There are instincts found only during the periods of
infancy, and represent an inner guidance leading to
the attamment of specific characteristics Growth is
thus not something vague like a progressive accumu-
lation of material or an mberent hereditary necessity
It 1s a process meticulously guided by transient instincts

250
GROWTH THROUGH ACTIVITY

which give an acute sensibility and an impulse towards
specific forms of activity, and these often differ very
plainly from the activites of the individual m the adult
state We may say mdeed that the profound difference
between the two states les m this. im reaching his full
stature and his full physical development, the adult has
at the same time actualised the instincts of lus species,
which will lead him to act in a stable manner on the
outer world. Whereas the infant creature more often
than not lacks the final instincts of his kind, and has
mstead a quantity of variable and successive istincts
which will lead him to acquire the characteristics of the
adult state

Such sensibilities, the effect of the transient guiding
insuncts of growth, enable us to understand the mces-
sant activity of nature. In the same way as pene-~
trating more deeply below the outer aspect of the
body we find organs and tissues functioning within,
which provide a detailed explanation of the existence
of a living body, with phenomena of a psychological
order we may explore beneath the surface and find the
different activities on which growth depends, The
sensitive periods in the child sometimes endow hum with
truly amazing powers. We may note for instance the
extraordinary keenness of a child’s senses, the keenness
of his eye to colours and dimensions, which guide his
attention to garner the smallest details of his environ-
ment. Wonderful too is the sensitive period of order of
Tespect of external objects and their place in the envi-
ronment It 1s through this sensibility that the child ss
able to orient himself, which would be smpossible had

251
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

not nature implanted such an aptitude in the infant
bemg

The child has a different motive principle from
the adult The adult acts m a whirl of external motives
which demand cold effort, sacrifice and wearisome
labour And if the adult 1s to be equal to hus task, the
child he was must have worked well, to make of him
a strong man

He has lost lus early sensibility, and nature will
now find hum a poor pupil who deserves to fail m her
rigorous examunations He cannot imitate the child

The child is driven forward by delicate sensibilities
aglow with intellectual love, which urge him indefat-
gably towards the outer world and make him garner
aumpressions of things as a spiritual milk on which he
must feed to nounsh his mner life That is why the
child’s psychic manifestations are at once impulses of
enthusiasm and efforts of meticulous, constant patience

The child does not grow weary with work, but m-
creases hus strength He grows through work and that
4s why work increases hus energies He never asks to
be reheved of his labours, but on the contrary he asks
to be allowed to perform them and to perform them
alone The task of growth is his life, he must truly
either work or die

The adult who 1s unaware of this secret cannot
understand the child’s work And, in fact, he has
never understood it, That 1s why he has always pre-
vented him from working, supposing that what the
child most needed in order to grow was rest The adult
has done everything for the child, for he has been gui-

252
a
GROWTH THROUGH ACTIVITY

ded only by his own natural laws of labour, the least
effort and the saving of ime Quicker and more skilful
than the child, he has dressed and undressed him,
washed him, fed him, carried him about in his arms or
in a perambulator, and arranged his environment with-
out allowing the child to help

When the child has been allowed a httle room “in
the world and in time, ” he proclaims as the first sign of
his eager defence, “ Me! Me want to do it!”

In the special environment prepared for him in our
schools, the children themselves found a sentence that
expressed this umner need “Help me to do it by
myself!” How eloquent 1s this paradoxical request !
The adult must help the child, but help him in such a
way that he may act for himself and perform his real
work in the world This sentence describes not only
the child’s need but what he requires from his environ-
ment * he must be surrounded by a hving environment,
not a dead one He wants not an environment to be
mastered and enjoyed but an environment that will help
hum to establish his functions = Plamly, the environ-
ment must be a hving one, directed by a higher intelli
gence, arranged by an adult who 1s prepared for his mis-
sion. Its in this that our conception differs both from
that of the world in which the adult does everything for
the child and from that of a passive environment in
which the adult abandons the child to himself

The spiritual embryo, lke the physical embryo,
needs a living environment in which to develop

This means that it 1s not enough to set the child
among objects m proportion to his size and strength ,

253
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

the adult who 1s to help him must have learned how to
do so If the adult, through a fatal misunderstanding,
mstead of helping the child to do things for himself
substitutes himself for the child, then that adult becomes
the blindest and most potent obstacle to the develop-
ment of the child’s psychic hfe In this misunder-
standing, in the excessive competition between adult
work and child work, hes the first great drama of the
struggle between man and his work, and perhaps the
origin of all the dramas and struggles of mankind

Such factors at once so delicate and so far-reaching
remind us of the tissues of the physical embryo,
which must be sheltered, enclosed m a protective
environment, so that the pattern of the form they con-
tam shall not be spoiled There 1s no doubt that for
the child, the spiritual embryo of man, we must con-
struct a protective and living environment. Now it will
not be enough to put withm the child’s reach certain
means of activity of proportionate size and destined
for his use for the exercise of his constructive energies
Nor will it be enough to give a few counsels to mothers
or to the adults m general who are fondest of the child
and closest to him What is needed is something on a
far vaster scale For the child shows not only desires
to be satisfied but a whole life to be evolved, of which
the adult has remained unconscious, and which needs
most delicate care It 1s no exaggeration to say that
man who up til now has built only a world for the
adult must set to work to build up a world for the child.
The treatment of the child 1s so complex and so deli-
cate that it needs something more than an awakening

m the mother, or the traimmng of new types of nurses
and teachers.

The response to the child’s needs must be a mental
renewal of education, which will be the centre of many
collateral sciences, till the crowning result 1s achieved,
a new philosophy of life

GUIDING INSTINCTS

In nature too, we find two forms of life, adult life
and mfant life, different and often contrary. Adult
life 1s characterised by struggle, the struggle of adapta-
tion to the environment as described by Lamarck, or
the struggle of competition and natural selection des-
cnbed by Darwin—a struggle not only for the survival
of the species but also for selection in sexual competi-
tion,

What happens among fully grown ammals might be
compared with the happemmgs im the social hfe
of men Here, too, we find the effort of self-preserva-
tion and defence against enemies , here too, struggles
and labours to achieve adaptation to the environment ,
and here, too, love and sexual conquest. In
struggles and labours to achieve adaptation to the envi-
ronment ; and here, too, love and sexual conquest. In
such struggle and competition Darwin saw the workings
of evolution, and the explanation of the survival of
physical forms, just as materialistic historians have at-
tnbuted the historical evolution of mankind to struggle
and competition among men

But whereas wn explaining human history we have
no other data than the doings of the adult, it is not

255

so m nature On the contrary, the real key to the
life that persists and establishes itself im nature, reveal-
ing the umumerable and marvellous variety of crea-
tures, hes m the chapter set apart for mfancy All
creatures are weak before they grow strong enough to
struggle, and all begin at a stage where there can be no
question of adaptation of their organs, for these organs
do not yet exist. No living creature begins as an adult

There 1s thus a hidden part of life with other forms,
other resources, other motive impulses, than those ap-
parent in the interplay between the strong individual
and his environment This chapter, the chapter of
childhood im nature, holds the real key to life, for what
happens to the adult can explain only the hazards of
survival

Biological investigations of the infant life of crea-
tures have thrown light on the most marvellous and
complex aspect of nature, revealing staggering realities,
sublime possibilities, which fill all living nature with
poetry and almost with religion. In this field biology
has followed and brought to light the creative and con-
servative aspects of the species, showing the existence
of instincts that act as mner guides to living creatures,
and which, to distinguish them from the mass of mm-
pulsive instincts connected with ummediate reactions
between a creature and its environment, may be termed
“guiding mstuncts ”

In biology all existing instincts have always been
grouped into two fundamental classes, according to
their ends, viz, mstmcts for the preservation of the
individual and imstincts for the preservation of the spe-

256
GUIDING INSTINCTS

cies Both cases offer aspects of struggle, connected
with transient episodes, and as 1t were, with encounters
~ between the mdividual and its environment; and at
the sametime in both cases there are instincts that
show themselves as constant vital guides, with an
emumently conservative function. For instance, among
the instincts for the preservation of the mdividual, the
aspect of episodic struggle is represented by the instinct
of defence agamst unfavourable or threatenmg causes.
Among the instincts for the preservation of species
there 1s the episodic instinct aroused by encounters with
other creatures in the form either of sexual umon or
sexual conflict. These episodic details, as the more
noticeable and violent, were the first to be recognised
and studied by biologists But later on more study was
devoted to the instincts for the Preservation of the indi-
vidual and the species im their conservative and
constant aspect. These are the guiding instincts, with
which 1s bound up the very existence of life in its great
cosmic function. Such instincts are not so much reac-
fons to the environment as delicate inner sensibilities,
intrinsic to life, just as pure thought is an entirely in-
tmnsic quahty of the mind, We might continue the

257
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

‘The guiding instincts are especially wonderful when
they are directed to guiding and protecting infant life
at its begimmmngs, when a creature 1s still hardly in exist-
ence or immature, but 1s none the less on the road
towards full development At such a stage it has not
acquired its ractal characteristics, it has nesther strength
nor resistance nor the biological weapons of struggle,
nor hope of a final victory as the sure pnze of survival
Here the guiding instinct acts as at once a form of
maternity and a form of education, and both are deep
hid, like the secret of creation from nothing Such
guidance carries a helpless creature to safety when it
has in itself neither material nor strength to save itself

One of these guidmg mstincts concerns motherhood,
the wonderful instinct described by Fabre and by
modern biologists as the key to the survival of creatures
‘The other concerns the development of the individual,
and has been dealt with by the Dutch biologist, De
Vnies, in his study of the sensitive periods

The maternal instinct 1s not confined to the mother,
though she, as direct procreatrix of the species, has the
larger share in this task of protection _It ss to be found
in both parents, and sometimes pervades a whole social
group of creatures A profounder study of what 1s
known as the maternal mstinct leads us to recognise
it as a mysterious energy, which 1s not necessarily as-
sociated with living creatures, but which exists as a
protection to the species even without matenal vehicle,
as m the words of the Book of Ecclestasticus, “From
the beginning, and before the world, was I created ”

The term matemal mstinct is thus a genenc term

258
GUIDING INSTINCTS

for the guiding instinct of preservation of the species.
There are certain characteristics which dommate this
domain in all species; the maternal mstinct means a
sacrifice of all other instincts existing in the adult for
ensuring its survival The fiercest anunal will show a
gentleness and tenderness at variance with its nature ,
the bird which flies so far in search of food or to flee
from danger, will remain still to watch over its nest,
finding other means of defending itself from danger,
but never that of fight Instincts mherent in the spe-
cies suddenly change mm character, Besides this, in
many species, a tendency to construction and work ap-
pears such as 1s never found in the same creatures at
other times, for once arrived at adult state they adapt
themselves to nature as they find it. The new instinct
of protection of the species leads to a constructive
labour so as to prepare a dwelling and shelter for the
new-born young In this every species and variety
of creature obeys a special guidance. None takes
the first material 1t finds within its reach, or adapts its
manner of building to locality. No, its mstructions are
definite and unvarying The manner of building the
nest, for instance, 1s one of the differential characteris-
ties of the different varieties of birds Among msects
we find stupendous examples of constructive work , the
hives of bees are palaces of a perfectly geometrical
architecture, which a whole society has combined to
build to house the new generation There are other
less striking cases which are none the less extremely in-
teresting, like spiders, which are exceptional in that they
build also for themselves, and know how to stretch such

259,
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

wide and slender nets for their enemies All at once
the spider radically changes her work and, forgetung
her own necessities, begins to make a tiny sack of new,
very fine, densely woven tissues, which are quite water-
proof Often the sack has double walls, making it an
excellent shelter in the damp, cold places m which
certain varieties of spiders lve = There 1s thus real
wisdom in regard to the exigencies of the chmate In-
side, i safety, the spider lays her eggs But what 1s
strange 1s that she has a passionate affection for her
sack In certam Jaboratory observations it has been
noticed that such spiders, with their grey, slimy bodies
in which no amount of searching will ever find a heart,
can die of gnef if their sack 1s torn and destroyed. In
fact, 1t has been discovered that the spider, where she
can, remains as attached to her work as if the sack were
an extension of her body She loves the sack, but she
has no feeling for the eggs, nor for the tuny live spiders
that will come forth from them She seems mdeed
quite unaware of their existence Instinct has led thi
mother to work for the species as direct object. There
can thus be an mstinct without object, actmg utesis-
tubly, representing an obedience to an mner com-
mand to do what 1s necessary, and bmnging a love
for what has been commanded

There are butterflies which, ther whole lives
through, suck the nectar of flowers without bemg
aware of any other enticements or any other food.
But when the tme comes for them to lay their eggs,
they never lay them on flowers They are then other-
wise guided, the food-seeking imstinct proper to the

260
GUIDING INSTINCTS

mdividual changes, and they are led to seek another
environment, one that is suited to a new species need-
ing other food And yet these butterflies are unaware
of such food, just as they will never know the species
that 1s to come They bear in themselves a com~
mand of nature, foreign to their own bemg The
cochineal msect and others sumilar never lay their
eggs on the upper side of the leaves that will serve as
food to the tiny grubs, but on thew under surfaces,
so that the grubs may be sheltered and hidden We
find like “tntelligent reflection” among a large number
of msects, which also never eat the plants they choose
for their offsprmg They have therefore a theoretical
knowledge of how their children will feed, and they
even foresee the dangers of rain and sun

The adult creature with the mission of protecting
the new creatures, thus changes its characteristics and
transforms its own nature, as though a time had come
in which the usual law governing its hfe stood stil m
expectation of a great event im nature—the muracle
of creation Then it does something that is not hving
but, one might say, a rite to be performed in the
presence of this miracle

One of nature’s most resplendent miracles is indeed
the power of the newly born, with no experience at
all, to find ther way about and protect themselves
im the outer world, guided by partial and transitory
instincts which show themselves as Sensitive Periods.
Here the instinct is truly and literally a guide leading
them gradually through successive difficulties and an-
mating the new creatures with irresistible power It
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

1s plain that nature has not surrendered the protec-
tion of the newely born to the adult, she holds the
tems tight and keeps a vigilant watch on the obser-
vance of her precepts The adult must collaborate
within the lumits set by the guiding mstincts for the
protection of the species Often, as we see in fishes
and insects the two forms of guiding mstinct, that m
the adult and that in the new creature, act separately
and independently, so that parents and children never
meet In higher anumals, on the other hand, the two
istmncts gradually converge in the meeting of parent
and offspring, and harmonious collaboration ensues
It 1s mm the encounter of the maternal guiding imstincts
with the sensitive periods of the newly born that con-
scious love develops between parent and child. Or
else maternal relations may extend to the whole of an
organised society, which treats the new offspring as a
whole, the livmg, impersonal products of a race
This we find among social sects like bees, ants, and
so forth

Love and sacnfice are not the cause of the pro-
tection of the species, but the effects of an ammating
guiding instinct of which the roots stretch down to
the vast creative laboratory of life, from which every
species draws its forces of survival Affectionate
feeling only renders the task imposed an easier one,
giving to effort that especial delight that 1s found in
perfect obedience to the order of nature

If we wished to embrace the whole adult world in
a single glance, we might say that from time to time
there 1s a breach of the laws proper to it, the laws

262
GUIDING INSTINCTS

that are most apparent in nature and which therefore
are believed to be absolute and unchangeable. And
lo! these invincible laws are broken ; they stay their
working, as though to leave place for something higher,
and they bow before factors in contradiction to them-
selves. That is to say, they remain suspended to fur-
ther new laws which appear in the infant hfe of the
species It is thus that life is maintamed; it 1s
renewed by such suspension, which allows it to reach
inward towards eternity

Now we may ask, what is the part of man im these
laws of nature? Man, it 1s said, contains in himself
as in a supreme synthesis all the natural phenomena
of the beings beneath him; he epitomises and trans-
cends them And what 1s more, by the privilege of
mind, he enhances them with the sparkling splendour
of the mind, which 1s made up of imagination, feeling
and art.

How then are the two forms of hfe presented in
mankind and under what sublime aspects do they
reveal themselves? The fact 1s, the two lives are not
apparent. Seek as we will through the world of men,
we must say that it embraces only a world of adults
of which the prevailing features are struggle, efforts at
adaptation, and labour for outward conquests. The
events of the world of men all converge on conquest
and production, as though there were nothing else to
be considered. Human effort clashes and 1s broken
in competition, hke a tempered blade against a breast-
plate. If the adult considers the child, he does so
with the logic he brings to bear on his own hfe. He

263
GUIDING INSTINCTS

Can. the highest and most essential guiding instinct
of life be totally absent in mankind? Can mankind
be truly helpless and blind before the most stagger-
ing phenomenon of universal hfe, upon which the
existence of the species depends ?

Man should feel something of what other creatures
feel, for im nature everythmg is transformed but
nothing is lost, and the energies that govern the um-
verse are especially indestructible They persist even
when deviated from their proper object

Where does man the builder build especially for
lus child? The child should hve in a state of beauty,
in which man expresses his loftiest forms of art, an
art that 1s not contammated or determmed by any
outward need, m which an impulse of generous love

notes how “As the primitive lullaby 1s nothing but a patient
prophecy (the mother’s), so was education, some two hundred
years ago, nothing but an impatient prophecy (the father’s)
of the full stature of body and mind” Thus John Evelyn’s
child “—'that pretty person’ m Jeremy Taylor’s letter of
condolence—was chiefly precious to him inasmuch as he was,
too soon, a likeness of the man he never lived to be

“Evelyn and his contemporaries dropped the very word
child as soon as might be, 1f not sooner When a poor hittle
boy came to be eight years old they called him a youth
It 1s difficult to umagine what childhood must have been when
nobody, looking on, saw any fun in it, when everything that
was proper to five years old was a defect

“They took their children seriously, without relief Evelyn
has nothing to say about his httle ones that has a sign of a
smile mit Twice are children not his own mentioned in his
diary Once he goes to the wedding of a maid of five years
old—a curious thing, but not, evidently, an occasion of sensi-
bility Another time he stands by, m a French hospital, while
a youth of less than nme years of age undergoes a fnghtful
surgical operation ‘with extraordinary patience. ‘The use
I made of it was to give Almighty God hearty thanks that I
bad not been subject to this deplorable infirmities’ This 1s
what he says.” TRANSLATOR’s NOTE,

stores up riches that cannot be utilised in the world
of production Are there places where man feels the
need to suspend and forget his usual characteristics,
where he perceives that the essential thing that main-
tains hfe 1s somethmg other than struggle? Where
he perceives as a truth msing from the deep that to
oppress others 1s not the secret of survival or the im-
portant thing in life, but of purely individual concern ?
Where therefore a surrender of self seems truly hife-
giving? Is there no place where the soul aspires to
break through the iron laws that hold it bound to the
world of outward things? Is there no anxious quest
for a miracle, a need for a muracle to continue hfe?
And at the same time an aspiration towards some-
thing beyond the furthest span of imdividual hfe,
stretching into eternity? It 1s by this road that salva-
tion hes In such places man feels the need to re-
nounce hus laborious reasoning and 1s ready to believe
the credible For all these are the feelings that
should be aroused in man by facts analogous to those
that lead all living creatures to a suspension of the
laws of their nature, to a holocaust of themselves, so
that life may be carned forward towards eternity
Yes, there are places where man no longer feels the
need for conquest, but the need of pumfication and
imnocence, so that he yearns for simplicity and peace
In that imnocent peace, man seeks a renewal of hfe,
as it were a resurrection from the weight of the world

This 1s the divine voice that no one can still, and
which calls men with a loud voice, calling them to-

CHAPTER
THE CHILD AS MASTER
“KNOW THYSELF”

To trace the guidmg instincts in man is one of the
most umportant subjects of research for the present
‘day. We ourselves have started such investigation
and we have brought it from non-existence to a
beginning In this our chief contribution to the ques-
tion hes But it barely opens the new road of inves-
tigation, for our results all now have been more than
anything the proving of the existence of such mstincts
and a first outhne of how they should be studied
Their study 1s only possible in the normalised child,
who [ives in freedom in an environment fitted to the
needs of his development. Then a new nature shows
itself, with such clarity that its normal characters m-
pose themselves as indisputable realities
Innumerable experiences have shown us a truth
that 1s equally revolutionary in two domains, that of
education and that of the social organisation of man-
kind. It 1s plain that the social organisation of men of
different nature from that commonly known, would
itself be different, and xt is education that may point
the way to a normalisation of the adult world also.
Such a social reform would not come about through

267
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

theory or on the energies of a few organisers, but
through the slow constant emergence of a new world
in the midst of the old—the world of the child and of
the adolescent From this world the revelations, the
natural guidance necessary to the normal life of society
would gradually evolve It 1s truly absurd to sup-
pose that theoretical reforms or imdividual energies
could remedy so colossal a void as that made im the
world by the repression and enslavement of the child.
No one can remedy the ever growing evils of which
the first roots le in the fact that men are all abnormal
because thew mfancy could not develop along the
lunes traced by nature, who therefore suffered uwreme-
diable deviation

The unknown energy that can help humanity 1s
that which hes hid im the Child,

To-day it 1s time to revive the dictum “Know
thyself” It 1s the source of all the biological sciences
which have helped to better and save the physical life
of man through modern medicine and hygiene, mark-
ing what 1s almost the level of a higher civilisation, a
civilisation characterised by physical hygiene

But m the domain of mind man 1s still unknown to
himself The first researches when he sought to know
hus physical self were carried out on the bodies of the
dead. The first researches when he would know his
psychic self deal with the living man as soon as he 1s
born.

Without these basic considerations it would seem
that there 1s no way open to progress or mdeed, one
mught almost say, to the survival of humanity in our

268
“KNOW THYSELF ”

eivitsation All the problems involved m social
questions must remain unsolved, like the problems
envisaged im modern scientific pedagogy For an
improvement in education can have only one basis,
the normalisation of the child Once this 1s obtained,
not only do pedagogic problems become soluble, but
indeed they no longer present themselves And, what
is more, the results obtained are as unlooked for and
amazing as miracles

Maybe the same procedure is required for adult
humanity. And here there 1s only one true problem,
that implied by the words “Know thyself” —knowledge
of the underlying laws that guide the psychic develop-
ment of man But the child has already solved this
problem, and a practical path has been opened. Out-
side this, there is no sign of any salvation practically
possible For every good thmg comes down upon
deviated men who seek to possess it for themselves,
and seek to make of it a means to power. Then the
good thing is destroyed even before it can be of ser-
vice, and thus becomes a danger to human hfe That
is why every good thing, all progress, all discoveries,
can increase the evil afflicting the world, as we have
seen in the case of machme, which represents the most
tangible form of social progress for us all Every dis-
covery that might mean elevation and progress can be
used for destruction, for war, or for self-enrichment
The progress of physics, chemistry and biology, the
perfecting of means of transport, have only magnified
the danger of destruction, wretchedness and the ap-
pearance of a cruel barbarity. We have therefore

269
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

nothing to hope from the external world till the norma-
lisation of man 1s recogmsed as a basic achievement
of social hfe Only then will all external progress
be able to lead to welfare and a higher civilisation

We must therefore turn to the child as to the light-
house of our future hfe Anyone wishing to succeed
1m some am for the good of society, must necessarily
turn to the child, not only to save him from deviation,
but also to learn from hum the practical secret of our
own hfe From this point of view the figure of the
child presents itself as potent and mysterious, an
object of meditation, for the child who holds in bim-
self the secret of our nature becomes our Master

THE FATHER’S MISSION

The child’s parents are not his makers but his
guardians They must protect and care for lum, im
the deepest sense, as a sacred mission that goes far
beyond the interests and ideas of external hfe They
are for him supernatural guardians, to be compared
to the guardian angles of mystical theology, who de-
pend directly and solely from heaven, who have a
power superior to that of any human authonity, and
who, united to the child in a way of which he 1s un-
aware, cannot be separated from him For such a
mussion parents must purify the love nature has um-
planted in their hearts, and they must understand that
such love is the conscious part of a deeper guidance
which must not be contaminated by egotism or apathy
It 1s for parents to visualise and embrace the social

question facing us at the present day, the struggle to
establish the nghts of the child in the world.

Much has been said of recent years about the rights
of man, and especially about the rights of the worker,
but now the time has come when we must speak of
the social rights of the child The social question of
the rights of the worker has been the basis of social
transformations, for humanity ves by the work of
men, and hence this question was connected with the
material existence of humanity as a whole But if
the worker produces what man consumes, and is a
creator in external things, the child produces man-
lund itself, and therefore his rights are still more potent
wn calling for social transformation. It is plain that
human society should direct its wisest and most per-
fect care to the child, to receive from him greater
strength and greater values in the humanity of the
future

The fact that it has instead neglected and indeed
forgotten the child, that it has, maybe, unconsciously
tormented and killed him, has failed to recognise his
value, his power, his essential nature, should be rea-~
lised and this feelng should arouse the conscience of
humanity in a vehement manner.

THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

Till yesterday, till the begmning of the present
century, society showed not the smallest concern for
the child. It left him where he was born, to the sole
care of his family, As his sole protection and defence,
there was the authonty of the father, which 1s more

271
‘THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

or less a relic of that established by Roman Law over
two thousand years ago During so long a period of
time, civilisation evolved, changing its laws m favour
and in the service of the adult, but it left the child
without any social defence To him were reserved
only the matenal, moral or intellectual resources of
the family mto which he was born And if in Ins
family there were no such resources, the child had to
develop in material, moral and intellectual mdigence,
without society’s feelmg the smallest responsibility for
him Society up till now has never claimed that the
famuly should prepare itself im any way to receive and
fitungly care for the children that might come to form
part of it. The State, so mgorous m demandmg
official documents and meticulous preparations, and
which so loves to regulate everythmg that bears
the smallest trace of social responsibility, does not
trouble to ascertain the capacity of future fathers to
give adequate protection to their children or to guard
their development It has provided no place of ims-
truction or preparation for parents As far as the
State 1s concerned, it 1s enough for anyone wishing to
found a family to go through the marnage ceremony
In view of all this, we may well declare that society
from earliest times has washed its hands off those
little workers to whom nature has entrusted the task
of building up humanity In the midst of a contunual
progress in favour of the adult they have remamed as
bemgs not belonging to human society, extra-social,
isolated, without any means of communication that
would allow society to become aware of their condi-

272
THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

tion They might be victims without society’s beng
aware.

And, in truth, they were victims

Victims indeed, as science recognised, when about
half a century ago medicine began to interest itself in
childhood At that time childhood was still more
abandoned than to-day, there were neither child
specialists nor children’s hospitals Statistics revealed
so high a mortality during the first year of life that it
caused asensation Pepole began to reflect that though
many children were born into families, few remained
alive. The death of small children seemed so natural
that families had accustomed themselves to it, com-
forting themselves with the thought that such little
children went straight to heaven There had come to
be a special spwitual preparation teachmg resigned
submission to this kind of recruitment of little angels,
whom, it was said, God wished to have near Him
Such vast numbers of babies died through ignorance
or lack of proper care that the phenomenon was term-
ed the constant slaughter of innocents

The facts were made public and at once an exten-
sive propaganda was begun to awaken human consci-
ences to a new sense of responsibility It was not
enough for families to give life to their children, but
they must save that hfe And science showed how
this could be done. fathers and mothers must gain
new knowledge and receive the instruction necessary
for a proper care of the health of their babies

But it was not only in famihes that children
suffered. Scientific investigations in the schools led

273
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

to alarming revelations of torment And this was m
the last decade of the XIX Century—at a tume when
medicine was discovermg and studying industnal
diseases among workers, and showing the first steps
to be taken for social hygiene in work. It was then
perceived that besides infectious diseases ‘resulting
from unhygieme conditions, children too had ther
“«ndustnial” diseases—the result of ther work

Thew work lay im the schools They were shut
up there, slaves, exposed to the enforced torments of
society The narrow chest that brought an acquired
predisposition to tuberculosis, came from long hours
spent bending over desks, learning to read and write
The spinal column was curved through the same en-
forced position, eyes were short-sighted through the
prolonged effort of trymg to see without sufficient
light The whole body was poisoned, as it were
asphyxiated, through long periods spent m small,
closed spaces

Yet their torment was not only physical , it exten-
ded to mental work Studies were forced studies, and
what with tedium and fear, the children’s minds were
tuwed, their nervous systems exhausted They were
lazy, discouraged, melancholic, vicious, with no faith
in themselves, with none of the lovely gaiety of child-
hood

Unhappy children! Oppressed children !

Their famihes realised nothing of all this What
concerned them was that their children should pass
their exammations and learn their lessons as quickly
as possible, so as to save time and money It was

274
THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

not learning in itself, the attamment of a loftier cul-
ture that concerned the families, but the response to
the summons of society, to the obligation imposed, an
obligation which they found burdensome and which
‘cost money What was therefore umportant was that
their sons should acquire their passport into the life
of society in the shortest time possible

Enquiries and investigations then carned out among
school-children brought to light other startling facts
Many poor children when they came to school were
already tired out by ther morning’s labours Before
going to school some of them had walked miles to dis-
tribute milk, or had gone running and shouting through
the streets, selling newspapers, or had been working at
home They reached school hungry, sleepy, with the
sole wish to rest. These poor hittle victums then
received a larger share of punishments, for they could
not pay attention to their teacher and so did not under-
stand his explanations And the teacher, concerned
for his responsibilty and still more for his authonty,
tned by punishments to awaken the interests of these
worn out children and to drive them to obedience by
threats He would humiliate them before all their
school-fellows, for incapacity or obstinacy Such
unfortunate children spent their lives exploited at
home and punished at school.

The injustice revealed by these first investigations
and enquiries was such that it led to a genuine social
reaction The schools and the relevant regulations
were speedily modified A new and important branch
of medicine was inaugurated, covering School Health

and exercising a protective and regenerating mfluence
on ail the official schools of civilsed countnes Doctor
and teacher were henceforth associated for the good
of the pupils This ways, we may say, the first social
sanction agaist an ancient unconscious error in the
whole of humanity and it marked the first step to-
wards the social redemption of the child

If we look back to this mitial awakening and follow
the course of history, we shall find no saltent fact
revealing a recogmtion of the nghts of the child, or an
mtuitive awareness of his importance Christ alone
called them to Him, pomtmg them out to adult man
as his guides to the Kingdom of Heaven, and warning
tum of his bhndness But the adult continued to
think only of converting the child, puttmg himself
before him as example of perfection It seemed as
if this termble blindness was mcurable Mystery of
the human soul! This blindness has remained an
‘universal phenomenon and 1s perhaps as old as man-
kind

In fact im every educational ideal, m all pedagogy
up to our own time, the word education has been
almost always synonymous with the word punish-
ment, The end was always to subject the child to
the adult, who substituted himself for nature, and set
hus reasoning and his end im the place of the laws of
fe Dufferent nations have different ways of punish-
ing children. In private schools the punishments m
use are often pomted out as they might poit out
ther coat of arms Some use humiliations, like tymg.
placards to the children’s backs, puttmg dunces’ caps

on their heads, or putting them in a real puillory so
that those who pass can laugh at them and mock
them. Often the pumishments used are physical tor-
tures. Children are put to stand m a corner for
seyeral hours, tired, bored by idleness, seemg nothing,
but condemned to hold their position by their own
will.

Other punishments are to make them kneel on
stone floors with bare knees, or whipping, or public
caning. A modern refinement of cruelty comes from
the theory of associating school and family in the
work of education—a principle which resolves itself
into organising school and family in mfictwng punish-
ment and tormenting the child The child who 1s
punished in school must consign his sentence to his
father, so that the father may jom with the teacher im
punishing him and scoldmg him. He is then forced
to take back to school a wmting from his father, as
a proof that he has accused himself to his other exe-
cutioner, who associated himself, at least m pmn-

1It is tempting to make one more quotation from Alice
Meynell, Tout passe Is the fruit for the flower, or the flower
for the fruit, or the fruit for the seeds which it 1s formed to
shelter and contain ?

It seems as though our forefathers had answered these ques—
tions most arbitrarily as to the hfe of man.

“But impatience of the way and the wayfarmg was to dis-
appear from a later century—an age that has found all
things to be on a journey and all things complete im ther
day because it 1s ther day, and has its apported end. It

made, that has caused the childhood of children to seem, at
Jast, something else than a defect."—That Pretty Person.

ciple, with the persecution of his own son. Thus the
child 15 condemned to carry his own cross

There 1s no one to defend him Where 1s the tr-
bunal to whom the child can appeal, as condemned
crminals appeal? It does not exist Where is the
love mm which the child knows that he will find refuge
and consolation? It is not there School and family
are agreed in punishing him, for if this were not so
the pumshment would be lessened and thus education
would be abased.

But the family does not need reminders from school
to punish its children Investigations recently carried
out on the punishments in use in famihes (and one
such enquiry was carned out on the initiative of the
educational institute attached to the League of
Nations), show that even mm our own time there 1s
no country great or small in the world where children
are not punished in their families They are violent-
ly scolded, abused, beaten, slapped, kicked, dmven
out of sight, shut up in dark, fnghtenmg rooms,
threatened with fantastic perils, or deprived of the
litle reliefs which are their refuge m thew perpetual
slavery or the solace of torments unconsciously en-
dured, such as playing with their frends or eating
sweets or fruit. And finally there 1s a family pumsh-
ment of fasting mflicted usually in the evenmg, to go
to bed without supper, so that, all mght through,
sleep 1s disturbed by grief and hunger

Although among educated families punishments
have rapidly diminished, they are still in use, and
tough manners, a harsh, severe and threatenmg voice,

278
THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

are usual forms of behaviour towards a child It
seems natural that the adults should have the nght
to beat the child, that lus mother may slap lum

And yet arbitrary and public corporal punishment
has been abolished for the adult It would now lower
his dignity and be a socral disgrace And yet what
greater baseness can be conceived than that of msult-
ing and persecuting a child? It is evident that the
conscience of humanity hes buried in a deep sleep

The progress of civilisation to-day does not depend
on individual progress, it does not spring from the
burning flame of the human soul, it 1s the advance of
an imsensible machine, driven by an external force
The energy that moves it emanates from the outer
world, like an ummense umpersonal power coming
from society as a whole, and functioning mexorably
Forwards '! Ever forwards !

Society 1s like a huge tram travelling with a ver-
tigmous velocity towards a distant pomt, while the
individuals composing it are hike travellers, asleep in
their compartments It 1s mm that sleepmg conscience
that we find the mightiest obstacle to any vital aid or
saving truth If this were not so the world would be
able to progress rapidly, there would not be the peri-
lous contrast between the ever greater speed of mate-
nial transport and the ever deeper-reaching mgidity of
the human spit, The first step, the most difficult
in any social movement towards a collective progress,
1s the task of awakening this sleeping and insensible

humanity and of forcing it to listen to the voice that
calls it

279
1a
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

To-day it 1s necessary that society as a whole should
become aware of the child and of his importance, and
that it should rapidly remedy the penl of the vast
void on which it rests It must fill that void by build-
ing the world for the child and recogmsing his social
rights The greatest cnme that society 1 commut-
ting 1s that of wasting the money it should spend for
its children, of dissipating it to destroy them and
itself Society towards the child has acted like a
guardian who dissipates the capital belonging to his
ward The adult world spends and makes for itself
alone, whereas clearly a great part of its wealth should
be destined for the child This truth 1s inherent in hfe
atself , the animals, the humblest msect, can teach it
to us For whom do the ants store up food? For
whom do the bees suck nectar? For whom do the
birds seek the food they carry to their nests? There
1s no example in nature of adults devourmg everything
themselves and leaving thems offspring m want. Yet
nothing 1s done for the human child , there is just the
bare endeavour to preserve his body in a state of vege-
tative life When wasteful society has urgent need of
money, it takes it from the schools and especially from
the infant schools that shelter the seeds of human hfe
It takes it from where there are neither arms nor voices
to defend it And therefore this 1s humanity’s worst
crime and greatest error Society does not even per-
ceive that it destroys twice over when it uses its money
for mstruments of destruction , it destroys by not en-
abling to hve and it destroys by bringing death And
the two are one and the same error, for it 1s precisely

through failmg to assure the development of life that
men have grown up im an abnormal manner

Adults must now organise afresh and this time not
for themselves but for their children They must raise
their voices to clam a mght that they cannot see
through their mnate blindness, but which, once seen,
1s indisputable If society has been a faithless guar-
dian to the child, it must now make restitution of his
goods and give him justice

There 1s a mighty mission before all fathers They
alone can and must save their children, for they have
the power to organise socially, and hence to act in the
practice of associated hfe Their consciences must feel
the force of the mission entrusted to them by nature,
a mission which sets them above society, which enables
them to dominate all material circumstances, for un their
hands hes positively the future of humanity, life

If they will not do so, they will act like Pontius
Pilate

Pilate in Palestine was all-powerful, for he had the
might of Rome behind him, the mperial power domi-
nating all other powers

Pilate could have saved Jesus He could have, but
he did not

The mob with their ancient prejudices, the laws in
force, custom, demanded the death of the mnocent,
the Redeemer, and Pilate remamed undecided and inert

“What can I do,” he must have thought, “if these
are the prevailing customs ”

And he washed his hands.

282
THE SECRET OF CHILDHOOD

He had the power to say “No, I will not!” But
he did not say it.

Fathers to-day behave like Pilate, they abandon
ther children to social custom, which 1s so powerful
as to seem a necessity

And thus the social tragedy of the child takes its
course Society abandons the child, without feeling
the smallest responsibility, to the care of his family,
and the family, for its part, gives up the child to society
which shuts him in school, isolatmg him from all
family control

Thus the child repeats the Passion of Chnist driven
from Herod to Pilate, tossed between the two powers,
who each deave Him to the responsibilty of the other

No voice 1s raised m the child’s defence, and yet
there is a voice that should have power to defend him,
the voice of the blood, the power of hfe, the human
authority of hus father

When the consciences of fathers awaken they will
not act lke Pilate, who to defend the Messiah demed
His divinity, bound Him, scourged Him, and was the
first to humiliate Him, saying “Ecce homo '”

This act lustory judges not as a defence of Chnist,
but as the first episode of His Passton

ECCE HOMO

Yes, the child will pass through a passion, like the
Passion of Christ

But the beginning of all lies in that Ecce Homo
Behold the man There is no God in lim = He 1s

282
ECCE HOMO

empty, and he has been humuliated and beaten by the
higher authority that could defend hm

After that he 1s dragged away by the crowd, by
social authority For the child the school has been a
place of more than natural woe Those big buildings
seem made for a host of grown-up people, and every-
thing 1s proportionate to the adult, the windows, the
doors, the grey corndors, the bare, blank walls There
the child of many, many generations put on the black
uniform of mourning which would last through the
whole period of childhood On the threshold his
family left hum, for that door was forbidden them
Here was the separation of the two domais and the
two responsibilities And to the child, weeping and
without hope, his heart shaken by fear, it was as if he
read on the door Dante’s inscription over the gates of
Hell -

“Through me men go into the city of weeping,

Through me men pass to the people of the lost”

It was a stern, threatenmg voice that summoned
lim to come im with other unknown companions,
judged en masse as wicked creatures, who must be
pumshed. Agam Dante’s verse comes to mind~

“Woe unto you, evil souls ”

Where will the child go?

He will go where he 1s ordered, where he 1s sent

He has been judged He will go into a class room,
and someone will do as Dante’s Minos, who, twisting
hus tail round his body, showed the lost soul to which
circle it was destined But everywhere there 1s eternal
woe, with no escape.
